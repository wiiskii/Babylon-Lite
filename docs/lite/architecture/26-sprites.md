## Purpose

Lite's design rule is "build things on top of previous things." Sprites are
2D quads. World-anchored ("2.5D") labels are 2D quads whose pixel position
is computed each frame from a 3D anchor. Camera-facing world-sized
billboards are different geometry (world-unit size, perspective
foreshortening, depth participation), and so they remain a separate family.

The module exposes **two** sprite families:

1. **`Sprite2DLayer`** — the foundation. Pixel-coordinate quads, no view
   matrix, no perspective divide, no required camera. Each layer chooses
   its depth participation at construction (`depth: "none" | "test" | "test-write"`),
   which becomes part of the pipeline cache key. The same layer factory
   serves three callers:
    - **Pure-2D apps** (no scene): layers are handed to a `SpriteRenderer`
      that the caller constructs and registers on the engine.
    - **HUD overlays** on a 3D scene: same — a `SpriteRenderer` constructed
      by the caller, registered after the scene, with disposal tied to the
      scene via `onSceneDispose`. HUD layers (`depth: "none"`) **never**
      go through `addToScene`.
    - **Depth-hosted sprites** that sort against 3D meshes
      (`depth: "test"` or `"test-write"`): added via
      `addDepthHostedSpriteLayer(scene, layer)`. That opt-in function queues
      them into the existing renderable system so they
      participate in the 3D depth attachment.

    World-anchored sprites are not a separate family. They are
    `Sprite2DLayer` sprites with an opt-in `AnchorSource` adapter that runs
    on the CPU in a per-frame `_beforeRender` hook, projects the world
    anchor through the scene's camera, and writes the resulting layer-space
    `positionPx` (and optionally a derived per-instance `z`) directly into
    the same per-instance slot a pure-2D sprite uses. The vertex shader,
    per-instance layout, packed buffer, and pipeline are **identical** to a
    pure-2D layer.

2. **`*BillboardSpriteSystem`** — two orientation factories
   (`createFacingBillboardSystem` and `createAxisLockedBillboardSystem`),
   with distinct WGSL basis paths and pipeline keys inside the current compact
   shared billboard renderable/pipeline module. That module is dynamically
   imported only by the scene add helpers when a billboard system is actually
   queued for a scene.
   World-coordinate quads, world-unit size, perspective foreshortening,
   full depth participation. Drawn inside the scene's 3D pass; not usable
   from the pure-2D path (no camera). Yaw-locked billboards are axis-locked
   with [0, 1, 0] as the lock axis.

`SpriteAtlas` and `SpriteFrame` are shared across both families. Clip
animation, stable handle objects, and parenting are roadmap modules that must
remain additive and separately importable so index-only scenes pay zero bytes
for them.

### Pillars (front and centre)

- **No `if` on render path.** Family selection, anchor mode, and depth
  mode are all decided at layer/system construction time and baked into
  the pipeline cache key. The per-frame draw walks fixed arrays, with
  no per-sprite mode test.
- **Pay-for-use.** A pure-2D app's static import graph terminates at
  `engine` + `sprite-atlas` + `sprite-2d` + `sprite-renderer`. It never
  imports `scene-core`, `Camera`, `Mesh`, `LightBase`, depth/MSAA targets,
  billboard renderables/pipelines, or anchor projection code. Tree-shaking
  removes them all.
- **One engine loop, two registerable kinds.** `startEngine(engine)`
  walks `engine._renderingContexts` once per frame. Pure-2D apps
  register one or more `SpriteRenderer`s; HUD-on-3D apps register a
  `SceneContext` followed by a separate `SpriteRenderer` for the HUD.
  Depth-hosted Sprite2D layers go through `addDepthHostedSpriteLayer` and
  are drawn inside the scene's 3D pass via the existing renderable system. The
  engine has no notion of "2D vs 3D" — it just iterates registrations;
  scene contexts execute their frame graph, and sprite renderers open a
  sprite-only swapchain pass.
- **Extensions over hardcoding.** Anchoring remains a roadmap tree-shakable
  add-on that should be imported only when a scene actually uses world anchors.
  Billboard scene rendering is behind `billboard-scene.ts`;
  importing a billboard system factory alone does not import the scene
  renderable, pipeline, or WGSL body.

## Taxonomy — Two Sprite Families

| Family                   | Variants                         | Coordinate space                                         | Size unit   | Depth                                   | Drawn by                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Sprite2DLayer`          | 1 (with optional `AnchorSource`) | Pixels (layer-space; CPU-projected for anchored sprites) | Pixels      | Configurable per layer (composer-baked) | A `SpriteRenderer` registered on the engine (pure-2D, or HUD-on-3D registered after the scene), or — for `depth: "test" \| "test-write"` layers — the scene's 3D pass |
| `*BillboardSpriteSystem` | 2: `Facing`, `AxisLocked`        | World                                                    | World units | Read; write configurable                | The scene's 3D pass (no pure-2D path)                                                                                                                                 |

### Why anchored is no longer a family

A naive design would split `Sprite2DLayer` and an `AnchoredSpriteLayer`
into two families because anchored sprites need a `viewProjection` to
project their world anchor, and anchored sprites that should occlude
behind 3D geometry need a depth attachment. That separate-family design
would have its own WGSL composer, its own 112-byte instance stride
(worldPos + offsetPx + depthBias), and its own GPU vertex-stage
projection.

That shape is wrong for three concrete reasons:

1. **The actual difference is one CPU operation per anchored sprite per
   frame.** Project a world anchor through `viewProjection`, divide by `w`,
   scale to viewport pixels, write the result into the same `positionPx[2]`
   slot a pure-2D sprite would use. This is one Mat4 × Vec4 (16 FMAs) plus
   2 multiplies and 2 adds. For typical anchored populations (HUD pins,
   nameplates, map markers — dozens to a few hundred) this is microseconds
   per frame. Doing it on the CPU keeps the GPU pipeline, the per-instance
   layout, the packed buffer stride, and the WGSL vertex shader **byte-
   identical** to a pure-2D layer.

2. **Depth participation is a per-render-pass attachment decision, not a
   per-family decision.** Modelling it as a family leaks a pass-level
   constraint into the layer type and forces the public API to choose one
   shape ("anchored") instead of letting any 2D layer opt into depth
   testing. Modelling it per layer (`depth: "none" | "test" | "test-write"`)
   is the correct level of granularity. Each value is a pipeline-cache key
   bit baked once at composition time — never branched at runtime.

3. **The 3D scene UBO (viewProjection + camera basis + viewport)
   was paid for solely to GPU-project anchors.** Once we project on the
   CPU, anchored layers do not need that UBO at all (the camera basis
   appears only as the `viewProjection` matrix consumed by the CPU
   projection helper, and `viewportPx` already lives in the pure-2D scene
   UBO). The 3D scene UBO becomes a billboard-only artefact, which it
   morally always was.

The roadmap "anchor" is a small interface:

```typescript
export interface AnchorSource {
    /** Project this anchor for the current frame.
     *  Writes into outPx (length 2) and outZ (length 1, view-space depth).
     *  Returns false to hide the sprite this frame (off-screen, behind camera, parent not yet built). */
    readonly project: (outPx: Float32Array, outZ: Float32Array, scene: SceneContext) => boolean;
}
```

`AnchorSource` should live in a separate `sprite/anchor/sprite-anchor.ts`
module. A scene that never instantiates an anchor must never import that module
or pay bytes for camera-basis projection code.

### Why billboards remain a separate family

Billboards are not "Sprite2D + a different anchor source." Their
differences are per-vertex, not per-CPU-update:

- **World-unit sizing.** Billboard quads are extruded in world units along
  camera basis vectors **before** projection (`cameraRight * sizeWorld.x +
cameraUp * sizeWorld.y`), which produces correct perspective
  foreshortening. Anchored sprites are extruded in pixel space **after**
  projection. These are opposite contracts (size shrinks with distance vs.
  size invariant under distance) — the entire reason each variant exists.

- **Per-vertex camera basis.** Each billboard variant computes
  `(right, up)` per vertex from the camera (`Facing`), or from a lock axis
  plus camera direction (`AxisLocked`, which includes yaw-locked as
  `[0, 1, 0]`). The pure-2D vertex shader has no camera basis input at
  all and ships zero camera-basis code.

- **Depth-write semantics.** Cutout billboards write depth (so they cast/
  receive against opaque meshes); anchored sprites never write depth.

Forcing billboards through the Sprite2D pipeline would either require a
per-vertex `if (isBillboard) { compute world basis } else { compute pixel
offset }` (violating the no-`if`-on-render-path rule), or a CPU "project
four corners" path (O(N×4) Mat4×Vec4 per frame against tree forests, the
exact cost the billboard vertex-shader trick was invented to avoid).
Splitting them is correct.

The two orientation factories remain explicit (`createFacingBillboardSystem`,
`createAxisLockedBillboardSystem(atlas, axis, opts)`) — two shader basis paths,
two pipeline keys, no `axisLock?: 'none'|'y'|Vec3` flag. Yaw-locked billboards
are just `createAxisLockedBillboardSystem(atlas, [0, 1, 0], opts)`.

### Modes deliberately not added

- **World-aligned non-billboard sprite** — use a `Mesh` with a textured
  alpha-blended material.
- **Tile maps (`SpriteMap`-like)** — separate future module.
- **2D-camera scene with pan/zoom** — that is `Sprite2DLayer.view`
  (per-layer pan + zoom + rotation), no additional family.

## Resolution: One engine loop, two registerable kinds

**Decision: the engine has a single registration list. Two kinds of
things implement `RenderingContext` and can be registered with an
engine: a `SceneContext` (via `registerScene(scene)`) and a
`SpriteRenderer` (via `registerSpriteRenderer(sr)`). `startEngine(engine)`
walks `engine._renderingContexts` once per frame. The engine owns the
command encoder and swapchain view for the frame; each context runs
`_update()` and `_record()` against that current frame state. A
`SceneContext` records through its `FrameGraph` (normally the default
swapchain `RenderTask`), while a `SpriteRenderer` opens its own
sprite pass directly on the swapchain. Pure-2D experiences
(Lottie/Rive-class apps) create one or more `SpriteRenderer`s and
register them on the engine — they never touch `SceneContext`. HUD-on-3D
apps register a `SceneContext` first, construct a separate
`SpriteRenderer` for the HUD layers, register it after the scene so it
draws on top, and tie its disposal to the scene via
`onSceneDispose(scene, () => disposeSpriteRenderer(hud))`. Depth-hosted
Sprite2D layers (`depth: "test" | "test-write"`) are added through
`addDepthHostedSpriteLayer`, which registers a deferred builder through the
scene's generic optional-renderable hook. The hook inserts a generic renderable
into the scene so it sorts and composites against 3D meshes inside the scene's
3D pass.**

The `SceneContext` shape, the `addToScene` switch body, and the default
frame graph stay sprite-agnostic. The sprite module does not add a second scene type or an
implicit HUD layer list to `SceneContext`; composition remains explicit
at the engine-registration level.

### Rejected alternatives

| Alternative | Why rejected |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Add a `Scene2DContext` parallel to `SceneContext` | Two parallel APIs for the same operation. Both kinds of registerable already share `RenderingContext` — no new umbrella type is required. |\n| Force pure-2D apps through `SceneContext` | A Lottie/Rive-class app then carries `SceneContext`'s shape and any per-frame branching it implies. Pure-2D experiences should not pay for scene infrastructure. |\n| Pure-2D users own their own `requestAnimationFrame` loop and call a free `renderSprite2DLayers(engine, layers, target)` function | Two different loop owners (engine for scene-based, user for pure-2D) means two first-frame-ready handshakes, two fixed-delta contracts, two device-loss recovery paths. Making the engine the sole loop owner via `register*` is a smaller surface area and frame-graph-shaped. |\n| Auto-route HUD layers through `addToScene` and have `registerScene` lazily create + register an internal `SpriteRenderer` | Adds bytes to scenes that don't have HUDs (everyone pays for the lazy-init code path), couples the sprite module's lifecycle to the scene module, and makes "what is registered on the engine" non-obvious to the caller. Explicit `createSpriteRenderer + registerSpriteRenderer + onSceneDispose` is three lines of caller code and zero bytes for non-HUD scenes. |\n| Refactor `addToScene` into method-on-entity routing + per-stage wrappers | Public objects must remain pure state; optional scene-hosted systems use standalone add helpers plus the generic deferred-renderable hook instead of attaching behavior to public data. |\n| Extract every sprite GPU detail into the scene render loop | Couples sprite rendering to scene orchestration. Then the pure-2D path either re-implements the GPU draws (forking) or pulls in scene infrastructure to reach them (wasted bytes). |

### The engine's registration list

```typescript
// src/engine/engine.ts — sprite support adds nothing here;
// this is the existing RenderingContext shape that both SceneContext
// and SpriteRenderer implement.

/** A thing that can be registered with an engine and driven once per frame. */
export interface RenderingContext {
    /** Draw calls produced by pre-pass work during `_update` (shadows + pre-passes). */
    _drawCallsPre: number;
    /** Clear color used when this context is the first active one in a frame. */
    clearColor: GPUColorDict;
    /** Per-frame update: beforeRender hooks, shadow + pre-passes, UBO updates. */
    _update(): void;
    /** Record frame work using the engine's current encoder/swapchain view. Returns draw-call count. */
    _record(): number;
}

/** @internal Inside EngineContext: */
//   _renderingContexts: RenderingContext[];

export function registerRenderingContext(engine: EngineContext, context: RenderingContext): boolean;
export function unregisterRenderingContext(engine: EngineContext, context: RenderingContext): boolean;

/** Drive the engine's render loop. Walks _renderingContexts in order, once per frame. */
export function startEngine(engine: EngineContext): Promise<void>;
```

`startEngine` resolves on the first frame after registration completes
successfully. Per-frame the engine acquires the swap-chain view +
creates one command encoder, then stores them on the internal engine
state for the current frame. It calls `_update()` and `_record()` on
each registered context in order. Scene contexts execute their frame
graph tasks; sprite renderers record a sprite-only swapchain pass. There
is no per-frame `if (is2D)` branch; the loop just iterates.

### The `SpriteRenderer`

```typescript
// src/sprite/sprite-renderer.ts
import type { EngineContext, RenderingContext } from "../engine/engine.js";
import type { Sprite2DLayer } from "./sprite-2d.js";

/** Options accepted by `createSpriteRenderer`. */
export interface SpriteRendererOptions {
    /** Layers to draw, in registration order. The renderer also re-sorts internally
     *  by `layer.order` each frame (TimSort is O(n) on already-sorted input). */
    layers: readonly Sprite2DLayer[];
    /** Default true. Set false for HUD overlays so the sprite pass preserves existing scene color. */
    clear?: boolean;
    /** Default `{ r: 0, g: 0, b: 0, a: 1 }`. Used when `clear` is true. */
    clearValue?: GPUColorDict;
}

/** A `SpriteRenderer` — pure data, plugs into `engine._renderingContexts`. */
export interface SpriteRenderer extends RenderingContext {
    readonly _kind: "sprite-renderer";
    /** Renderer-owned layer membership. Use add/remove helpers to mutate. */
    readonly layers: readonly Sprite2DLayer[];
}

export function createSpriteRenderer(engine: EngineContext, opts: SpriteRendererOptions): SpriteRenderer;
export function addSpriteRendererLayer(sr: SpriteRenderer, layer: Sprite2DLayer): void;
export function removeSpriteRendererLayer(sr: SpriteRenderer, layer: Sprite2DLayer): boolean;
export function registerSpriteRenderer(sr: SpriteRenderer): void;
export function unregisterSpriteRenderer(sr: SpriteRenderer): void;
export function disposeSpriteRenderer(sr: SpriteRenderer): void;
/** Redirect output to an offscreen render texture (render-to-texture), or null = swapchain.
 *  See "Offscreen render target" below. */
export function setSpriteRendererTarget(sr: SpriteRenderer, target: Texture2D | null): void;
```

A `SpriteRenderer` does **not** own persistent color/depth attachments.
During `_record` it opens a sprite-only render pass directly on the
per-frame swapchain view using `sampleCount = 1`, the engine's swapchain
format, and no depth attachment. `clear: false` makes the pass use
`loadOp: "load"`, which is the HUD path after a 3D scene has already
resolved into the swapchain. Pure-2D layers use a 40-byte instance layout
with no Z attribute; depth-hosted layers use the 44-byte layout with
per-instance Z.

Internally `SpriteRenderer._update`:

1. Refreshes cached target dimensions (canvas may have resized).
2. Sorts the renderer-owned layer list in place by `layer.order` (skipped for the
   single-layer case).
3. For each visible non-empty layer: ensures GPU resources exist, writes
   per-instance data and per-layer UBO via `device.queue.writeBuffer`
   only when the data has actually changed (compares against a CPU-side
   shadow of the last bytes written).

Internally `SpriteRenderer._record`:

1. For each visible non-empty layer: looks up (or builds and caches) a
   `GPURenderBundle` that bakes `setIndexBuffer` + `setPipeline` +
   `setBindGroup` + `setVertexBuffer` + `drawIndexed(6, count)`. The
   bundle is rebuilt only when the layer's sprite count changes or its
   instance buffer is reallocated.
2. Replays all visible bundles with one reused `pass.executeBundles(...)` array — skips
   per-call WebGPU validation and IPC, near-zero CPU cost in the steady
   state.

The `SpriteRenderer` is the single home for HUD/pure-2D sprite GPU draw
logic. Depth-hosted Sprite2D layers (`depth: "test" | "test-write"`) do
not go through it — they are drawn by an independent `Renderable`
produced by `sprite-renderable.ts` (see "Caller 2" below).

### Offscreen render target (render-to-texture)

By default a `SpriteRenderer` records its pass on the per-frame swapchain view
(`rr._targetView ?? eng._swapchainView`). Two small, **opt-in, tree-shakable**
additions let a renderer draw into an offscreen texture instead, which is the
building block for full-screen post-processing (the platformer demo's CRT/scanline
effect is built entirely on these — no bespoke engine pass):

```typescript
// src/texture/pixels-texture.ts
export interface RenderTexture2DOptions {
    addressModeU?: GPUAddressMode; // default 'clamp-to-edge'
    addressModeV?: GPUAddressMode; // default 'clamp-to-edge'
    minFilter?: GPUFilterMode;     // default 'linear'
    magFilter?: GPUFilterMode;     // default 'linear'
    format?: GPUTextureFormat;     // default engine.format (REQUIRED for a SpriteRenderer target)
}
/** An empty Texture2D usable as BOTH a render target and a sampled texture
 *  (RENDER_ATTACHMENT | TEXTURE_BINDING | COPY_DST). */
export function createRenderTexture2D(engine: EngineContext, width: number, height: number, options?: RenderTexture2DOptions): Texture2D;

// src/sprite/sprite-renderer.ts
/** Point a renderer at an offscreen render texture (`Texture2D`), or null for the swapchain (default). */
export function setSpriteRendererTarget(sr: SpriteRenderer, target: Texture2D | null): void;
```

Both default to the swapchain / swapchain format, so **every existing scene and
demo is byte-for-byte unaffected**, and the whole capability tree-shakes away when
unused (`createRenderTexture2D` is a separate import; `_targetView` defaults to
`null`).

> **Format constraint:** a `SpriteRenderer` target must use `engine.format`. Sprite
> pipelines are created with that format, and WebGPU rejects a render pass whose color
> attachment format differs from the bound pipeline (validation error at pass begin).
> So leave `RenderTexture2DOptions.format` at its default for any texture you pass to
> `setSpriteRendererTarget`; a custom format is only for offscreen targets driven by a
> different pass (e.g. an `EffectRenderer`).

The render-to-texture pattern is two registered renderers, ordered:

1. **Scene pass** → `setSpriteRendererTarget(scene, rt)` so it draws into an
   offscreen `rt = createRenderTexture2D(engine, w, h)` (sized to the canvas backing
   store, swapchain format so it can be sampled and presented).
2. **Present pass** → a second `SpriteRenderer` owning one full-screen layer whose
   atlas IS `rt` (via `createGridSpriteAtlas`), drawn with a custom-shader fragment
   (e.g. CRT curvature + scanlines). It targets the swapchain (`target = null`) and is
   registered **after** the scene pass, so it runs second and samples the finished
   frame. Toggling the effect off is `setSpriteRendererTarget(scene, null)` +
   unregistering the present pass — restoring the direct path for zero overhead.

The offscreen texture and present layer must be rebuilt on canvas resize (the RT is
a fixed-size GPU texture). See `lab/lite/src/demos/platformer/crt.ts` for a complete,
toggle-able implementation.

### Caller 1: pure-2D — no `SceneContext`

A Lottie/Rive-class app never creates a scene. It creates a
`SpriteRenderer`, registers it on the engine, and lets `startEngine`
drive the loop:

```typescript
const engine = await createEngine(canvas);
const atlas = await loadSpriteAtlas(engine, "sprites.png", { gridSize: [32, 32] });
const layer = createSprite2DLayer(atlas);
addSprite2DIndex(layer, { positionPx: [100, 200], sizePx: [64, 64], frame: 0 });

const sr = createSpriteRenderer(engine, {
    layers: [layer],
    clearValue: { r: 0, g: 0, b: 0, a: 1 },
});
registerSpriteRenderer(sr);

await startEngine(engine);
```

The static import graph is exactly: `engine` + `sprite-atlas` + `sprite-2d` +
`sprite-renderer`. Nothing else.
No `SceneContext`, no `addToScene`, no `registerScene`, no `Camera`, no
`Mesh`, no `LightBase`, no depth/MSAA target allocator, no PBR, no
Standard, no shadow generator, no animation-group walker, no anchor
projection, no billboard variants.

Anchored sprites are not supported in this path — there is no camera to
project against. They require the scene-based path below.

### Caller 2: scene-based — `registerScene` + `addToScene` + a separate HUD `SpriteRenderer`

The new `registerScene(scene)` is the scene-side analogue of
`registerSpriteRenderer`. It runs the scene's deferred builders and
registers the scene as a `RenderingContext` on the engine. After that,
`startEngine(engine)` drives the scene each frame just like it drives
any other registered context.

```typescript
export function registerScene(scene: SceneContext): Promise<void>;
export function unregisterScene(scene: SceneContext): void;

/** Register a callback to fire when `disposeScene(scene)` is called.
 *  Used to tie user-owned GPU resources (e.g. a HUD `SpriteRenderer`)
 *  to the scene's lifetime — mirrors `onBeforeRender`. */
export function onSceneDispose(scene: SceneContext, cb: () => void): void;
```

The scene module exposes one generic optional-renderable hook. The sprite
module uses it from `addDepthHostedSpriteLayer`; that opt-in helper statically
imports the sprite-owned renderable builder because calling the helper is the
explicit feature choice:

```typescript
import { buildSpriteRenderable } from "./sprite-renderable.js";

export function addDepthHostedSpriteLayer(scene: SceneContext, layer: Sprite2DLayer): void {
    if (layer.depth === "none") {
        throw new Error('Sprite2DLayer with depth: "none" must be rendered via createSpriteRenderer, not addDepthHostedSpriteLayer.');
    }
    addDeferredSceneRenderables(scene, (engine) => {
        const built = buildSpriteRenderable(engine, layer);
        return { renderables: [built.renderable], dispose: built.dispose };
    });
}
```

`buildSpriteRenderable` rejects `depth: "none"`, because scene renderables
require a depth policy. `addDepthHostedSpriteLayer` performs the same check
before queuing work. HUD layers use `SpriteRenderer` directly.

The existing `"billboard-sprite-system"` branch stays as today (with its
own `_deferredBuild` hook); billboards are pushed into the existing
scene-level renderable arrays.

`registerScene(scene)` does exactly two things: runs each
queued `_deferredBuild` (so depth-hosted sprite renderables are wired
into the scene's `_renderables` list), then calls
`registerRenderingContext(engine, scene)`. **It does not create or
register any HUD `SpriteRenderer`** — HUDs are an explicit caller
concern (see below).

End-to-end (HUD-on-3D scene, mirrors `lab/lite/src/lite/scene52.ts`):

```typescript
const engine = await createEngine(canvas);
const scene = createSceneContext(engine);

addToScene(scene, createDirectionalLight([0, -1, 0]));
addToScene(scene, await loadGltf(engine, "world.glb"));
const trees = createAxisLockedBillboardSystem(treeAtlas, [0, 1, 0]);
addAxisLockedBillboardSystem(scene, trees);

// Depth-hosted anchored labels: same Sprite2DLayer factory, depth:"test"
// routes it through addDepthHostedSpriteLayer → sprite-renderable, drawn
// inside the scene's 3D pass.
const labels = createSprite2DLayer(labelAtlas, { depth: "test" });
addAnchoredSprite2D(labels, {
    anchor: createWorldAnchor([0, 1.8, 0]),
    sizePx: [128, 32],
    frame: "name-bg",
});
addDepthHostedSpriteLayer(scene, labels);

await registerScene(scene);

// HUD overlay: separate Sprite2DLayer with depth:"none", drawn by a
// separate SpriteRenderer registered AFTER the scene so it draws on top.
// `addToScene` is never called for HUD layers — they have no business
// in the 3D pass.
const hud = createSprite2DLayer(hudAtlas, { depth: "none" });
addSprite2DIndex(hud, { positionPx: [16, 16], sizePx: [200, 32], frame: "score" });
const hudRenderer = createSpriteRenderer(engine, { layers: [hud], clear: false });
registerSpriteRenderer(hudRenderer);
// Tie HUD lifetime to the scene — disposeScene fires this and frees the GPU buffers.
onSceneDispose(scene, () => disposeSpriteRenderer(hudRenderer));

await startEngine(engine);
```

The punch line: **one** `createSprite2DLayer` factory and one public
Index API, with the per-layer instance layout fixed at creation. The
`depth` option chooses which path the layer ends up in:

- `depth: "none"` → caller hands the layer to a `SpriteRenderer` (pure-2D
  or HUD); never goes through `addToScene`. The layer uses a 13-float /
  52-byte instance layout and the pure shader keeps clip-space Z constant.
- `depth: "test" | "test-write"` → caller passes the layer to
  `addDepthHostedSpriteLayer`, which statically imports the depth-hosted
  renderable builder inside the opt-in scene integration module; layer is
  drawn inside the scene's 3D pass and sorts against meshes by per-instance
  Z. The layer uses the 14-float / 56-byte layout with slot [13] exposed to
  the shader as `@location(6) iZ`.

The world-anchor adapter described below is roadmap. The current depth-hosted
slice accepts explicit per-sprite `z` values and does not expose anchor helpers.

## Public API Surface

### Shared — Atlas and Frames

```typescript
// src/sprite/shared/sprite-atlas.ts
import type { EngineContext } from "../../engine/engine.js";
import type { Texture2D, Texture2DOptions } from "../../texture/texture-2d.js";

export type SpriteSampling = "linear" | "nearest";

/** A single frame in an atlas. UVs in [0,1]; pivot in [0,1] of the frame. */
export interface SpriteFrame {
    readonly name?: string;
    readonly uvMin: readonly [number, number];
    readonly uvMax: readonly [number, number];
    readonly sourceSizePx: readonly [number, number];
    readonly pivot: readonly [number, number];
}

export interface SpriteAtlas {
    readonly texture: Texture2D;
    readonly textureSizePx: readonly [number, number];
    readonly frames: readonly SpriteFrame[];
    readonly premultipliedAlpha: boolean;
}

export interface GridAtlasOptions {
    cellWidthPx: number;
    cellHeightPx: number;
    columns?: number;
    rows?: number;
    marginPx?: number;
    spacingPx?: number;
    pivot?: readonly [number, number];
    premultipliedAlpha?: boolean;
}

export interface LoadAtlasOptions {
    gridSize?: readonly [number, number];
    /** Reserved for a future TexturePacker-style JSON loader. Throws today. */
    metadataUrl?: string;
    sampling?: SpriteSampling;
    premultipliedAlpha?: boolean;
    premultiplyOnLoad?: boolean;
    textureOptions?: Texture2DOptions;
}

export function loadSpriteAtlas(engine: EngineContext, textureUrl: string, options?: LoadAtlasOptions): Promise<SpriteAtlas>;
export function createGridSpriteAtlas(texture: Texture2D, options: GridAtlasOptions): SpriteAtlas;
/** @internal */
export function resolveSpriteFrame(atlas: SpriteAtlas, frame: number): number;
```

A `SpriteAtlas` is a shared resource: the same atlas may back multiple
layers/systems across one or many scenes. Its `Texture2D` is uploaded
once at `loadSpriteAtlas`. Layers hold a reference; the atlas is released
only when no layer holds it (regular `Texture2D` lifetime).

`SpriteFrame.pivot` is in normalised `[0, 1]` of the frame — `(0.5, 0.5)`
centres the quad on the sprite's anchor. Frames are addressed by numeric index
today. Named frames, clip animation, and TexturePacker metadata are roadmap
additions and must land without adding bytes to numeric-index callers.

```

The Handle API (`addSprite2D` / `removeSprite2D`, returning a
`Sprite2DHandle` with a stable id) lives in the separately importable
`sprite-2d-handle.ts` module so Index-only scenes do not pull handle code,
maps, or typed arrays (see [Handles](#handles-identity-and-parenting)).
Observable fields and parenting remain additive follow-up modules.

```typescript
// src/sprite/sprite-2d-handle.ts — optional, tree-shakable Handle API.
export interface Sprite2DHandle {
  readonly _entityType: "sprite-2d-handle";
  readonly layer: Sprite2DLayer;
  readonly id: number;
}

export function addSprite2D(layer: Sprite2DLayer, props: Sprite2DProps): Sprite2DHandle;
export function updateSprite2D(handle: Sprite2DHandle, patch: Partial<Sprite2DProps>): void;
export function removeSprite2D(handle: Sprite2DHandle): void;
export function setSprite2DFrame(handle: Sprite2DHandle, frame: number): void;
export function getSprite2DHandleIndex(handle: Sprite2DHandle): number;
export function isSprite2DHandleAlive(handle: Sprite2DHandle): boolean;
```

### Blend modes — tree-shakable descriptors

Blend mode is **not** a string union backed by a static lookup table. Each mode is an
importable, pure-data descriptor value, so a scene ships only the descriptor(s) it imports —
a default (alpha) scene references `spriteBlendAlpha` and nothing else; importing
`spriteBlendAdditive` does **not** drag in `spriteBlendPremultiplied`. Adding a future blend
mode costs **zero bytes** to scenes that don't use it. The pipeline reads `_descriptor` / `_key`
/ `_premultipliedOpacity` directly off the value, so there is no runtime string `switch` for the
bundler to retain. The descriptors are byte-identical `GPUBlendState` to the old table, so
visual parity is unchanged.

```typescript
// src/sprite/sprite-blend.ts
export interface SpriteBlendDescriptor {
    /** @internal Pipeline-cache discriminator (distinguishes blend variants of one pipeline). */
    readonly _key: string;
    /** @internal Color-target blend state; `undefined` means no color blend (opaque). */
    readonly _descriptor?: GPUBlendState;
    /** @internal When true, per-layer opacity scales RGB *and* A (premultiplied fade). */
    readonly _premultipliedOpacity?: boolean;
}

export const spriteBlendAlpha: SpriteBlendDescriptor;          // straight-alpha "over" (default)
export const spriteBlendPremultiplied: SpriteBlendDescriptor;  // premultiplied "over"
export const spriteBlendAdditive: SpriteBlendDescriptor;       // glows/sparks: src*alpha + dst
export const spriteBlendMultiply: SpriteBlendDescriptor;       // shadow/tint: result = src * dst

// src/sprite/billboard-blend.ts — mirrors the above for world-space billboards.
export interface BillboardBlendDescriptor extends SpriteBlendDescriptor {
    /** @internal Depth/blend pipeline path this mode selects ("transparent" | "cutout"). */
    readonly _depthMode: BillboardDepthMode;
}

export const billboardBlendAlpha: BillboardBlendDescriptor;
export const billboardBlendPremultiplied: BillboardBlendDescriptor;
export const billboardBlendCutout: BillboardBlendDescriptor;   // alpha-test, depth-writing
export const billboardBlendAdditive: BillboardBlendDescriptor; // transparent, no depth write
```

Sprites support `alpha`, `premultiplied`, `additive`, and `multiply`. Billboards support
`alpha`, `premultiplied`, `cutout`, and `additive` — `multiply` is intentionally not offered for
billboards. The shared `blend-descriptors.ts` holds the two common states
(`_ALPHA_BLEND_STATE`, `_PREMULTIPLIED_BLEND_STATE`) so alpha/premultiplied don't duplicate
bytes.

### Per-layer custom fragment shaders

A layer/system may supply its own WGSL **fragment body** while the engine keeps ownership of the
transform, instancing, sorting, and depth. The factory returns an opaque, compiled-on-demand
descriptor passed as `customShader`:

```typescript
// src/sprite/sprite-custom-shader.ts
export type Sprite2DCustomTexture = CustomShaderTexture; // becomes `<name>Tex` + `<name>Samp` in WGSL
export interface Sprite2DCustomShaderOptions {
    readonly fragment: string;                              // WGSL fragment body
    readonly extraTextures?: readonly Sprite2DCustomTexture[];
}
export function createSprite2DCustomShader(options: Sprite2DCustomShaderOptions): Sprite2DCustomShader;

// src/sprite/billboard-custom-shader.ts — parallel API for world-space billboards.
export function createBillboardCustomShader(options: BillboardCustomShaderOptions): BillboardCustomShader;
```

The supplied `fragment` body has in scope: `in: VOut` (a 2D layer exposes `uv: vec2<f32>` and
`tint: vec4<f32>`; a billboard additionally exposes `viewDist` / `worldPos`); the layer atlas as
`atlasTex` / `atlasSamp` at bindings 1/2; each extra texture as `<name>Tex` / `<name>Samp`; the
`fx` UBO (`fx.time`, `fx.params`); and the `L` layer UBO (e.g. `L.opacityMul`). It must
`return vec4<f32>(...)` and may `discard`; the body owns all alpha handling (no per-layer opacity
is applied automatically). The constant `fx.params` vec4 is fed each frame via
`setSprite2DShaderParams(layer, params)` / `setBillboardShaderParams(system, params)`. Runtime
WGSL identifier re-mangling keeps user fragment code working in minified bundles.

**Tree-shaking via a lazy null registry (`sprite/sprite-fx-hook.ts`).** This is the architectural
crux, and it mirrors the PBR extension registry (`pbr-flags.ts`). The module declares two hook
interfaces (`SpriteFxHook`, `BillboardFxHook`) whose methods (`initLayer`, `pipelineKeyPart`,
`shaderModule`, `layoutEntries`, `createLayerFx`, `updateFx`, `bindEntries`, `disposeFx`) each
take the layer/system **opaquely**, so every `layer.customShader` / `layer.shaderParams` property
read happens *inside* the tree-shaken impl. It holds two module-level slots
(`let _spriteFxHook: SpriteFxHook | null = null`, `_billboardFxHook`) and the
`_registerSpriteFxHook` / `_getSpriteFxHook` / `_registerBillboardFxHook` / `_getBillboardFxHook`
functions — with no module-level side effects. The always-loaded sprite / billboard / pipeline /
renderer modules only ever call `_getSpriteFxHook()?.method(...)`; the slot stays `null` until
`createSprite2DCustomShader` / `createBillboardCustomShader` registers the impl. So a plain sprite
scene ships **zero** custom-shader tokens — not even the public `customShader` / `shaderParams`
field-name strings. `sprite-pipeline.ts`'s `spritePipelineKey` reaches the feature only through
`_getSpriteFxHook()?.pipelineKeyPart(layer)` (the `cs${customKey}` segment). The 2D and billboard
composers share their *mechanics* via `custom-shader-core.ts` (extra-texture bindings, name
validation, the `SpriteFx` UBO, key allocation) but keep their own vertex stage and varying
contract.

### Opt-in per-sprite UV scroll (parallax)

`uvScroll` is a **structural** opt-in, not a per-sprite value: enabling it changes the GPU data
layout and the compiled shader, so it follows the same pay-for-use gate as `depth`. When a layer
is created with `uvScroll: true`, every sprite gains two extra instance floats (`uvOffset.xy`)
that are added to the sampled UV in the vertex stage — enabling parallax / infinite-scroll
backgrounds without re-uploading texture coordinates. The offset is set per sprite via
`Sprite2DProps.uvOffset` (on add) or `setSprite2DUvOffset(layer, index, uvOffset)` (live).

Enabling the flag (1) widens the instance stride by two floats, (2) adds a
`@location(7) iUvOffset: vec2<f32>` vertex attribute, (3) selects a distinct WGSL variant
(`let uv = mix(...) + in.iUvOffset`), and (4) adds a `:uv${uvKey}` segment to the pipeline key so
variants don't collide. The widening is orthogonal to depth and lands *after* the base layout:

```text
pure-2D + uvScroll  (15 floats = 60 bytes):  [13..14] uvOffset.xy (float32x2 @ byte offset 52)
depth   + uvScroll  (16 floats = 64 bytes):  [14..15] uvOffset.xy (float32x2 @ byte offset 56)
```

(Source constants: `PURE_2D_UVSCROLL_STRIDE_BYTES`, `DEPTH_UVSCROLL_STRIDE_BYTES`,
`SPRITE_UVOFFSET_OFFSET_PURE_2D_BYTES = 52`, `SPRITE_UVOFFSET_OFFSET_DEPTH_BYTES = 56`.) Layers
created without `uvScroll` keep the narrow 13/14-float layout, the base attributes, and the base
WGSL — they ship none of the widening. The feature pairs naturally with a tileable atlas sampled
in `repeat` wrap mode
(`loadSpriteAtlas(..., { textureOptions: { addressModeU: "repeat", addressModeV: "repeat" } })`).

### Roadmap — `AnchorSource` opt-in 3D bridge for `Sprite2DLayer`

The APIs in this section are not part of the current root exports.

```typescript
// src/sprite/anchor/sprite-anchor.ts — separate module, dynamic-imported on first use.
import type { Sprite2DLayer, Sprite2DProps } from "../sprite-2d.js";
import type { SceneContext } from "../../scene/scene-core.js";
import type { IWorldMatrixProvider } from "../../scene/parenting.js";

export interface AnchorSource {
    readonly project: (outPx: Float32Array, outZ: Float32Array, scene: SceneContext) => boolean;
}

/** Static world-space anchor. */
export function createWorldAnchor(worldPos: [number, number, number]): AnchorSource;

/** World anchor that follows a moving entity (mesh, transform node, sprite handle). */
export function createParentAnchor(parent: IWorldMatrixProvider, localOffset?: [number, number, number]): AnchorSource;

/** Attach an AnchorSource to a sprite. The sprite's positionPx is overwritten each frame
 *  by the projection result. Layer must have depth !== "none" for occlusion against 3D geometry. */
export interface AnchoredSprite2DInit extends Sprite2DProps {
    anchor: AnchorSource;
    offsetPx?: [number, number];
    /** NDC-z bias added after projection (positive = pushed toward camera). Default 0. */
    depthBias?: number;
}

export function addAnchoredSprite2D(layer: Sprite2DLayer, init: AnchoredSprite2DInit): number;
export function setSprite2DAnchor(layer: Sprite2DLayer, index: number, anchor: AnchorSource | null): void;
```

The first call to `addAnchoredSprite2D` (or `setSprite2DAnchor` with a
non-null anchor) on a given layer:

1. Lazy-allocates a sparse `Map<number, AnchoredEntry>` on the layer
   (sprites without an anchor have no entry).
2. Installs a per-frame hook into `scene._beforeRender` (via `unshift`,
   so it runs before user `onBeforeRender` callbacks) that walks the
   layer's anchored map, calls each `anchor.project()`, and writes the
   resulting `positionPx`, optional `layerZ` (mapped from view-Z), and
   `depthBias`-adjusted ordering into the layer's flat storage via the
   same code path `updateSprite2DIndex` uses. Sprites whose `project`
   returns `false` get `sizePx = [0, 0]` written into their slot
   (degenerate quad — same trick as `visible: false`).
3. Registers a single disposable that removes the hook when the layer is
   disposed or its anchored map becomes empty.

```typescript
// In sprite-anchor.ts internal:
interface AnchoredEntry {
    anchor: AnchorSource;
    offsetPx: [number, number];
    depthBias: number;
}
```

A scene that has zero anchored sprites never imports `sprite-anchor.ts`,
never allocates the sparse map, never installs the projection hook, and
never pays for `viewProjection` on the CPU.

### Family 2 — `*BillboardSpriteSystem`

The current implementation slice is deliberately narrower than the full
billboard roadmap: it ships **Facing** and **Axis-Locked** billboards (with
yaw-locked as a special case of axis-locked using [0, 1, 0]), with
the low-level index API, explicit scene opt-in helpers, and CPU-side
transparent sorting for the current compact vertex-buffer upload. It also
ships the production cutout path: alpha-tested, depth-writing billboard
systems selected via `billboardBlendCutout`, plus **additive** blending via
`billboardBlendAdditive` and opt-in **per-system custom fragment shaders** via
`createBillboardCustomShader` (see [Per-layer custom fragment shaders](#per-layer-custom-fragment-shaders)).
Clip playback, observable handle fields, parenting, picking,
storage-buffer sort indirection, and a billboard `multiply` blend mode are
additive follow-up modules. Stable handle identity itself lives in
`billboard-sprite-handle.ts`. That split
keeps the first billboard path small and keeps pure-2D sprite bundles from
importing scene rendering code.

```typescript
// src/sprite/billboard-sprite.ts
import type { SpriteAtlas } from "./shared/sprite-atlas.js";
import type { BillboardBlendDescriptor } from "./billboard-blend.js";
import type { BillboardCustomShader } from "./billboard-custom-shader.js";

`BillboardSpriteSystem.order` is construction-time state: the renderable copies
it when the scene helper builds GPU resources during `registerScene`. Create a
new system when the render order must change after registration.

`setSprite2DFrameIndex` and `setBillboardSpriteFrameIndex` are UV-only
helpers. They preserve the sprite's explicit `sizePx`/`sizeWorld` even when
the target atlas frame has a different `sourceSizePx`. Callers that want
atlas-driven size changes should use `updateSprite2DIndex(layer, index,
{ frame, sizePx })` or `updateBillboardSpriteIndex(system, index,
{ frame, sizeWorld })` with an explicit size policy. For billboards, pixel
frame size never implies a world-space size. `setBillboardSpriteFrameIndex`
also preserves the sprite's current pivot; callers that want atlas-driven
pivot changes during animation should use
`updateBillboardSpriteIndex(system, index, { frame, pivot })`.

Flip state is encoded by swapping UV min/max endpoints, so frame setters
preserve flip state for non-degenerate atlas frames (`uvMin.x !== uvMax.x`
and `uvMin.y !== uvMax.y`). Zero-area atlas frames cannot encode flipped and
unflipped states distinctly; callers should avoid authoring collapsed UV
ranges or pass explicit `flipX`/`flipY` through the full update helpers when
recovering from such data.

`addFacingBillboardSystem(scene, system)` and
`addAxisLockedBillboardSystem(scene, system)` are the scene integration
points. They queue a deferred renderable builder through
`addDeferredSceneRenderables` so `scene-core` and `addToScene` stay
sprite-agnostic. The builder dynamically imports `billboard-renderable.ts`,
which imports `billboard-pipeline.ts`, `getSceneBindGroupLayout`, and the WGSL
composer. A scene that never queues a billboard system never runtime-fetches
that chunk. The helper signatures use orientation-specific system types so
normal TypeScript callers cannot pass an axis-locked system to the facing
helper or vice versa.

Internally, the shared renderable routes through `system._orientation` and
`system._depthMode`; the current public factories set `"facing"` or
`"axis-locked"`, and each blend descriptor carries its own `_depthMode` —
`"transparent"` for `alpha` / `premultiplied` / `additive`, and `"cutout"` for
`billboardBlendCutout`. Transparent systems are
alpha-blended, depth-tested, depth-write disabled, maintain a `_worldCenter`
for the scene's transparent bucket sort, and sort individual billboard
instances far-to-near before upload. `_worldCenter` is the center of the
active anchor bounds, not the arithmetic mean, because it is a proxy for the
system footprint when the render task sorts this one renderable against other
transparent renderables. The render pass runs binding updates before
transparent-bucket sorting so `_worldCenter` reflects any same-frame
billboard mutations before draw order is chosen. Cutout systems have no blend state,
discard fragments whose sampled texture alpha is below `alphaCutoff`, write
depth, and route through the non-transparent direct-draw bucket with `_direct`
rather than `_transmissive`.

Yaw-locked billboards (world-Y axis constraint) are created via
`createAxisLockedBillboardSystem(atlas, [0, 1, 0], opts)`.

### Roadmap — Picking

The picking APIs below are not part of the current root exports.

```typescript
// src/sprite/picking/pick-sprite-2d.ts — handles every Sprite2DLayer
// reachable from the scene (depth-hosted layers added via addToScene)
// AND the layers of any SpriteRenderer the caller hands in.
export function pickSprite2D(layers: ReadonlyArray<Sprite2DLayer>, xPx: number, yPx: number): SpritePickInfo | null;

// src/sprite/picking/pick-billboard.ts — GPU contributor.
export function pickBillboardSprite(scene: SceneContext, xPx: number, yPx: number): Promise<SpritePickInfo | null>;
```

`pickSprite2D` is the pure-2D picker: the caller passes whichever
`Sprite2DLayer` array it owns — `spriteRenderer.layers` for HUD overlays,
or `scene._renderables` (filtered to the Sprite2D `Renderable`s that
`addToScene` pushed there).
The picker iterates in reverse insertion order and, for each candidate
sprite, rotates the screen point into its pivot-aware local rectangle.
For anchored layers `positionPx` has already been projected CPU-side
this frame, so the picker hits the same screen rectangle the GPU draws.
No GPU pick pass for Sprite2D.

`pickBillboardSprite` is a GPU pick contributor; the full design is
specified under [Picking](#picking) below.

### Pure-2D usage — no scene

A pure-2D app skips the scene entirely. It creates a `SpriteRenderer`,
registers it on the engine, and lets `startEngine` drive the loop:

```typescript
import { createEngine, loadSpriteAtlas, createSprite2DLayer, addSprite2DIndex, createSpriteRenderer, registerSpriteRenderer, startEngine } from "babylon-lite";

const engine = await createEngine(canvas);
const atlas = await loadSpriteAtlas(engine, "sprites.png", { gridSize: [32, 32] });
const layer = createSprite2DLayer(atlas);
addSprite2DIndex(layer, { positionPx: [100, 200], sizePx: [64, 64], frame: 0 });

const sr = createSpriteRenderer(engine, {
    layers: [layer],
    clearValue: { r: 0, g: 0, b: 0, a: 1 },
});
registerSpriteRenderer(sr);

await startEngine(engine);
```

Nothing in `src/scene/*` is reachable from this code path — not even
`scene-core.ts`. Anchored sprites are unsupported here (they require a
camera).

---

## Internal Architecture

### Core Rule: No `if` Across Modes (still)

There is still no shared `createSprite()`, no `SpriteMode` enum, no per-
frame `if (sprite.kind === ...)`. The two families have separate composers,
separate renderables, separate WGSL. The unification happens at the
**scene** layer, not at the sprite-shader layer. The `AnchorSource`
projection is a CPU step on a sparse per-layer map; it writes into the
owning layer's already-fixed instance layout (52 B for pure-2D, 56 B for
depth-hosted).

### Per-Instance GPU Layout

`Sprite2DLayer` fixes its instance stride at creation from `depth`.
`depth: "none"` uses 52 bytes / 13 floats and has no Z lane. `depth:
"test" | "test-write"` uses 56 bytes / 14 floats and exposes slot [13]
as the per-instance depth attribute. Anchor data lives off-instance in a
sparse JS map. Per-layer constants (view, screen size, pivot, opacity)
live in a separate 48-byte UBO bound at `@group(0) @binding(0)` for the
pure renderer and `@group(1) @binding(0)` for the depth-hosted scene
renderable.

#### Sprite2DLayer pure per-instance vertex buffer (52 B = 13 floats)

| Offset (bytes) | Slot    | Field        | Vertex attr          | Notes                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0..7           | [0..1]  | `positionPx` | `@location(0)` f32×2 | layer-space pixels; for anchored sprites, written by the CPU sync hook    |
| 8..15          | [2..3]  | `sizePx`     | `@location(1)` f32×2 | width/height in pixels; zeroed when `visible: false` (degenerate quad)    |
| 16..23         | [4..5]  | `uvMin`      | `@location(2)` f32×2 | atlas UV min                                                              |
| 24..31         | [6..7]  | `uvMax`      | `@location(3)` f32×2 | atlas UV max                                                              |
| 32..35         | [8]     | `rotation`   | `@location(4)` f32   | radians; vertex shader takes `sin`/`cos` once per vertex                  |
| 36..51         | [9..12] | `colorRGBA`  | `@location(5)` f32×4 | four float32 channels, matching Babylon.js SpriteRenderer color precision |

#### Sprite2DLayer depth-hosted extension (56 B = 14 floats)

Depth-hosted layers use the same first 52 bytes, plus:

| Offset (bytes) | Slot | Field | Vertex attr        | Notes                                                             |
| -------------- | ---- | ----- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 52..55         | [13] | `z`   | `@location(6)` f32 | NDC depth (`0` = near, `1` = far), consumed by the scene pipeline |

#### Sprite2DLayer `uvScroll` extension (opt-in; +8 B = +2 floats)

Layers created with `uvScroll: true` append two more floats (`uvOffset.xy`) *after* the base
layout, orthogonally to depth. The wider stride, the extra `@location(7)` attribute, and the
`+ iUvOffset` WGSL are gated on the per-layer flag, so non-scroll scenes ship none of it.

| Layout               | Stride       | Slot     | Field      | Vertex attr          | Notes                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| pure-2D + `uvScroll` | 60 B / 15 fl | [13..14] | `uvOffset` | `@location(7)` f32×2 | `uvOffset.xy` at byte offset 52        |
| depth + `uvScroll`   | 64 B / 16 fl | [14..15] | `uvOffset` | `@location(7)` f32×2 | base 56 B + `uvOffset.xy` at offset 56 |

The vertex stage adds `in.iUvOffset` to the sampled UV (`let uv = mix(uvMin, uvMax, corner) + in.iUvOffset`),
and the pipeline key gains a `:uv${uvKey}` segment so scroll/non-scroll variants never collide.

Visibility (`visible: false`) is implemented by zeroing slots [2..3]; the
sprite's true size lives in `layer._savedSize` so a later `visible: true`
(without re-supplying `sizePx`) can restore it.

**Per-instance Z, not per-layer, for depth-hosted layers.** A single
depth-hosted layer can mix sprites at different depths — useful where
one sprite goes in front of a 3D object and another behind it. Pure-2D
layers do not allocate, upload, declare, or fetch a Z slot; `z` remains
accepted by the public props shape but is ignored before storage.

#### Sprite2DLayer Layer UBO (48 B = 12 floats; std140-aligned)

Bound at `@group(0) @binding(0)`. Updated each frame from current view +
target dimensions; written via `device.queue.writeBuffer` only when the
12-float scratch buffer differs from the previously-written copy.

| WGSL field   | Offset | Notes                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `viewPos`    | 0      | `vec2<f32>` — layer view's pan in pixels                                                                                                                                    |
| `viewScale`  | 8      | `f32` — layer view's zoom                                                                                                                                                   |
| `viewRot`    | 12     | `f32` — layer view's rotation in radians                                                                                                                                    |
| `screenSize` | 16     | `vec2<f32>` — engine target size in pixels                                                                                                                                  |
| `pivot`      | 24     | `vec2<f32>` — layer-wide rotation/scaling pivot in normalised sprite-local space                                                                                            |
| `opacityMul` | 32     | `vec4<f32>` — pre-shaped per layer opacity. Straight-alpha: `(1, 1, 1, opacity)`. Premultiplied: `(o, o, o, o)`. CPU pre-shapes per blend mode so the shader is branch-free |

Total 48 bytes — `vec4<f32>` forces 16-byte struct alignment and 48 = 3 × 16 is naturally
aligned; no padding required.

#### Current BillboardSpriteSystem instance layout (64 B = 16 floats)

The first facing-billboard slice uses a compact per-instance vertex buffer,
not a storage buffer or sort indirection. The buffer is bound as the sole
vertex buffer with `stepMode: "instance"`; the shader uses
`@builtin(vertex_index)` for the four quad corners and `drawIndexed(6,
system.count, 0, 0, 0)` for all active sprites.

| Offset (floats) | Field       | Vertex format | Notes                                                  |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0..2            | `position`  | `float32x3`   | world-space anchor                                     |
| 3..4            | `sizeWorld` | `float32x2`   | zeroed when hidden; true size mirrored in `_savedSize` |
| 5..6            | `uvMin`     | `float32x2`   | frame UV minimum, swapped with max when flipped        |
| 7..8            | `uvMax`     | `float32x2`   | frame UV maximum, swapped with min when flipped        |
| 9               | `rotation`  | `float32`     | radians, applied in camera-facing local space          |
| 10..11          | `pivot`     | `float32x2`   | normalized [0,1] pivot                                 |
| 12..15          | `color`     | `float32x4`   | RGBA tint stored as four float32 channels              |

The current system UBO is 32 bytes:

- `opacityMul` at byte offset 0: `vec4<f32>`. Straight-alpha and cutout write `(1, 1, 1, opacity)`; premultiplied writes `(opacity, opacity, opacity, opacity)` so the shader is branch-free.
- `axisAndCutoff` at byte offset 16: `vec4<f32>`. `xyz` is the normalized axis for axis-locked systems and zero for facing systems. `w` is the system `alphaCutoff` used only by cutout shaders.

The render pipeline uses the scene UBO at group 0 and the billboard UBO/atlas
bind group at group 1, with pipeline keys including render target format,
sample count, `_orientation`, blend mode, `_depthMode`, and depth format. The
shader module cache also keys by `_depthMode`: transparent shaders have no
discard path, while cutout shaders sample texture alpha, discard below
`billboards.axisAndCutoff.w`, and return the sampled color multiplied by tint and
`opacityMul`. The `"transparent"` depth mode uses depth compare `greater-equal`,
depth write off, no culling, and alpha, premultiplied, or additive blending. The
`"cutout"` depth mode uses depth compare `greater-equal`, depth write on, no
blend state, and no culling. The unsupported billboard `multiply` blend mode
throws during system creation.

Transparent billboard systems sort per billboard before upload, not by
mutating `system._instanceData`. When `DrawUpdateContext` supplies the active
pass `camera`, the billboard renderable gets the cached camera view matrix and
fills renderable-owned scratch arrays: view-space depths, stable index order,
and a sorted 64-byte-instance staging buffer. Depth is the view-space z of
each anchor (`view[2] * x + view[6] * y + view[10] * z + view[14]`), sorted
descending so farther billboards upload first. The same compact GPU vertex
buffer is written from the sorted staging buffer with one full
`queue.writeBuffer` when either the system version, camera identity, or
`camera.worldMatrixVersion` changes. Repeated frames with unchanged system data and unchanged
camera view skip the instance upload. Cutout billboard systems skip this
transparent sort path entirely and upload dirty ranges directly from
`system._instanceData` in logical insertion order, matching the direct
depth-write bucket semantics used by depth-hosted sprite layers.

This camera-dependent transparent sort is intentionally conservative: when
the camera moves, relative billboard order may change, so the renderable
recomputes depths and uploads the sorted compact buffer. Large transparent
systems should be split by region or depth band if exact interleaving with
other transparent renderables matters; one billboard system remains one
transparent renderable in the global scene sort.

#### Future target BillboardSpriteSystem (96 B = 24 floats)

The later handle/picking/storage-indirection roadmap moves billboard data
to a storage buffer at `@group(1) @binding(3)` (not a vertex buffer — 3D
sprite families read sprite data through a storage buffer indexed by a
sort-indirection vertex attribute, see below). The 24-float layout:

| Offset (floats) | Field         | Notes                                               |
| --------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 0..2            | `worldPos`    | xyz — anchor position in world space                |
| 3               | `_reserved`   | 0 (anchored layers use this slot for `depthBias`)   |
| 4..5            | `_reserved`   | (0,0) (anchored layers use these for `offsetPx`)    |
| 6..7            | `sizeWorld`   | width/height in world units                         |
| 8..9            | `pivot`       | normalized [0,1]                                    |
| 10..11          | `sinCos`      | precomputed sin/cos of rotation                     |
| 12..15          | `uvRect`      | uvMin.xy, uvMax.xy                                  |
| 16..19          | `color`       | RGBA tint                                           |
| 20..23          | `flagsAndPad` | float-encoded `[flipX, flipY, pickable, _reserved]` |

The lock axis (axis-locked variant only) lives in the **system UBO**, not
per-sprite. The reserved slots at floats 3..5 stay in the layout because
the same packed-buffer layout and pack helper signature is shared with
the depth-hosted Sprite2DLayer's anchored-write path (which uses those
slots for `depthBias` and `offsetPx`); for billboard-only systems the CPU
pack helper writes 0.0.

##### Sort Indirection + Storage Buffer

The future storage-buffer path keeps the same public invariant as the current
CPU-staging path: billboard systems never reorder the packed sprite buffer.
Sorting is expressed entirely through a separate `Uint32Array` indirection
buffer of sprite indices, uploaded once per frame as a per-instance vertex
attribute at `@location(0)`. The shader reads `sortIndex` and indexes into the
packed sprite storage buffer to fetch the actual record. This keeps sort upload
cost O(N), not O(N × stride).

**Packed sprite buffer.** Allocated by `sprite-gpu.ts` with
`usage: GPUBufferUsage.VERTEX | GPUBufferUsage.STORAGE | GPUBufferUsage.COPY_DST`.

**Sort indirection vertex buffer.** Per-instance Uint32 buffer at
`@location(0)` with `stepMode: "instance"`, `arrayStride: 4`, attribute
format `uint32`. One u32 per active sprite. Recreated when storage
capacity grows.

**Storage buffer binding.** Bound at `@group(1) @binding(3)` as
`var<storage, read> sprites: array<SpriteData>`. Bind-group layout entry
uses `buffer: { type: "read-only-storage" }` with
`GPUShaderStage.VERTEX` visibility. The renderable rebuilds the layer
bind group lazily — only when `system._storage.gpuBuffer` (the JS
pointer) changes between frames (capacity grew, or first sync).

**Shared WGSL.** `sprite/shared/sprite-3d-instance-wgsl.ts` exports two
TS string consts that every billboard variant shader includes:

```wgsl
// SPRITE_3D_DATA_WGSL — 96 B / 24-float storage record.
struct SpriteData {
    worldPos: vec3<f32>,
    depthBias_or_reserved: f32,        // anchored: depthBias; billboard: 0
    offsetPx_or_reserved: vec2<f32>,   // anchored: offsetPx; billboard: (0,0)
    sizePxOrWorld: vec2<f32>,          // anchored: sizePx;   billboard: sizeWorld
    pivot: vec2<f32>,
    sinCos: vec2<f32>,
    uvRect: vec4<f32>,
    color: vec4<f32>,
    flagsAndPad: vec4<f32>,            // .x flipX, .y flipY, .z pickable, .w reserved
};
@group(1) @binding(3) var<storage, read> sprites: array<SpriteData>;

// SPRITE_3D_VS_IN_WGSL — input/output structs + helpers.
struct VSIn {
    @builtin(vertex_index) vid: u32,
    @location(0) sortIndex: u32,
};
struct VSOut {
    @builtin(position) pos: vec4<f32>,
    @location(0) uv: vec2<f32>,
    @location(1) color: vec4<f32>,
};
fn rotate2(p: vec2<f32>, sinCos: vec2<f32>) -> vec2<f32> { /* ... */ }
fn cornerOf(vid: u32) -> vec2<f32> { /* 6-corner triangle list */ }
fn cornerUV(corner: vec2<f32>, rect: vec4<f32>, flipX: f32, flipY: f32) -> vec2<f32> { /* ... */ }
```

`SpriteData` field names are deliberately unified
(`depthBias_or_reserved`, `offsetPx_or_reserved`, `sizePxOrWorld`) so a
single struct definition serves both billboard variants and the
anchored-write path inside Sprite2DLayer. Billboard shaders ignore
`depthBias_or_reserved` and read `sizePxOrWorld` as world size.

**Re-sort triggers.** A re-sort runs only when at least one of the
following changed since the last sync:

- `_sortVersion` (bumped by add / remove / position update).
- Camera world-position (only matters for blended systems — cutout
  systems do not back-to-front sort).
- Sprite count (forces re-upload after grow).

**Cutout vs. blended.** Cutout systems always emit a sequential `0..N-1`
indirection (no per-frame back-to-front cost) so the shader path stays
uniform. Blended systems use insertion sort over squared camera
distance — fast for small N and near-sorted lists, which is the typical
case as the camera moves smoothly.

**`SpriteSortState`** (lives in `sprite/shared/sprite-sort.ts`):

```typescript
export interface SpriteSortState {
    indexBuffer: GPUBuffer | null;
    indices: Uint32Array;
    distances: Float32Array;
    lastSortVersion: number;
    lastCamX: number;
    lastCamY: number;
    lastCamZ: number;
    lastUploadedCount: number;
    blended: boolean;
    boundsCenter: [number, number, number];
}
```

**Bounds center for engine-wide transparent sort.**
`computeSpriteBoundsCenter(state, storage)` walks the first three floats of
every active slot, computes the center of the active anchor bounds, writes it into
`state.boundsCenter`, and returns it. The renderable copies this into
`Renderable._worldCenter` every frame so the engine-wide transparent
sort orders billboard systems correctly against transparent meshes.

**Helpers exported by `sprite-sort.ts`:**

- `createSpriteSortState(blended)` — allocate state. GPU buffer is created lazily on first sync.
- `syncSpriteSortIndices(engine, state, storage, sortVersion, camX, camY, camZ, label)` — ensures capacity, runs sort if any trigger fired, uploads via a single `writeBuffer`.
- `computeSpriteBoundsCenter(state, storage)` — center of active anchor bounds.
- `disposeSpriteSortState(state)` — release the GPU index buffer.

### Vertexless Quad

No vertex buffer for positions. Six invocations per instance from
`@builtin(vertex_index)` (triangle list):

```wgsl
const QUAD_CORNERS: array<vec2<f32>, 6> = array<vec2<f32>, 6>(
    vec2<f32>(0, 0), vec2<f32>(1, 0), vec2<f32>(1, 1),
    vec2<f32>(0, 0), vec2<f32>(1, 1), vec2<f32>(0, 1),
);
```

Draw call: `pass.draw(6, batch.count)` with `topology: 'triangle-list'`.
Triangle-list (not triangle-strip) eliminates a class of corner-case
driver differences across WebGPU implementations.

### CPU → GPU Sync (`sprite-gpu.ts`)

Each layer/system owns a single `Float32Array` packed buffer sized at
`capacity × stride`. On per-frame sync:

1. If `_version === _gpuVersion`, skip.
2. Otherwise, walk `[dirtyMin, dirtyMax]` and for each dirty slot pack
   the 20- or 24-float record. Resolve `frame` to UV rect via
   `atlas.frames[frameIndex]`.
3. Single
   `device.queue.writeBuffer(_gpuBuffer, dirtyMin*stride, _data.buffer, dirtyMin*stride, (dirtyMax - dirtyMin + 1) * stride)`.
4. `_gpuVersion = _version`.

Capacity grows 2× on overflow (fresh allocation + copy). The renderable's
GPU buffer reference is rebuilt internally on grow and the new buffer is
rebound at the next frame's `draw()` — callers hold no GPU buffer
handles, so no caller action is required. Sprite indices remain stable
across grows. Removal is **swap-remove** (last slot moves into the gap;
that slot's `_dirty` is bumped). Same pattern as `mesh/thin-instance.ts`.

This module is **dynamically imported** by every family renderable, so a
2D-only scene does not bundle billboard or anchored code.

Anchor projection feeds the dirty-range mechanism via the same
`updateSprite2DIndex` write path used by every other update. Anchor
sprites whose projected position changes every frame (the common case)
are effectively a full re-upload of the anchored sprites' contiguous slot
range each frame — same cost profile as a per-frame-moving particle
layer. Static anchors (parent never moves, camera never moves) skip
upload via the `_version === _gpuVersion` short-circuit.

#### Dirty / Version Tracking

| Field          | Bumped by                                                               | Checked by         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `_version`     | All `add*` / `update*` / `remove*` / `set*Frame` / clip-advance helpers | GPU sync           |
| `_gpuVersion`  | GPU sync after upload                                                   | —                  |
| `_sortVersion` | Camera change (billboard families) or any 3D-position change            | Sort recomputation |

#### Visibility (`visible: false`)

Toggling `visible: false` on a sprite does **not** compact the array or
shift indices. The pack step writes `sizePx = [0, 0]` (or
`sizeWorld = [0, 0]`) into the slot; the vertex shader collapses all six
vertices to a single point and the rasterizer emits zero fragments.
Indices stay stable, sort order is unaffected, and toggling visibility is
just a regular `update*({ visible })` call that bumps `_version`.
Trade-off: invisible sprites still cost their stride bytes in the
per-frame upload range. For layers with dense visibility churn (rare in
practice), split into two layers instead.

### Hook Registration Order

Per-layer animation/clip ticks AND the per-layer anchor-projection hook
both register into `scene._beforeRender` via `unshift`, so they run
before any user `onBeforeRender` callback. **This is required by the
freeze-flag contract**: applications that drive deterministic capture
(e.g. `seekTime` reference scenes) advance N frames and then set a
freeze flag in their own `onBeforeRender`; that callback must observe
the fully-advanced clip state on the freeze frame, otherwise the layer
loses one tick of animation in the captured image. All sprite families
(Sprite2D, anchored Sprite2D, Billboard) share this convention.

### Sprite2DLayer per-`depth` Pipeline State

| Layer `depth`  | Drawn via                                                                       | Depth attachment        | Depth compare   | Depth write | Instance layout / Z                  | Render order                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"none"`       | A `SpriteRenderer` registered on the engine                                     | none                    | none            | `false`     | 52 B / 13 floats; no slot [13]       | engine registration order; layer order within the renderer  |
| `"test"`       | `addDepthHostedSpriteLayer` → `sprite-renderable.ts` (renderable `order = 200`) | engine depth attachment | `greater-equal` | `false`     | 56 B / 14 floats; slot [13] consumed | scene transparent queue (after opaque meshes)               |
| `"test-write"` | `addDepthHostedSpriteLayer` → `sprite-renderable.ts` (renderable `order = 100`) | engine depth attachment | `greater-equal` | `true`      | 56 B / 14 floats; slot [13] consumed | direct-drawn after cached opaque meshes, before transparent |

The sprite pipeline cache key includes `(format, sampleCount, blendMode, hasDepth, depthWrite, depthStencilFormat)`, plus a `cs${customKey}` segment for custom-shader layers (contributed opaquely via `_getSpriteFxHook()?.pipelineKeyPart(layer)`) and a `:uv${uvKey}` segment for `uvScroll` layers. `SpriteRenderer`
layers always request `hasDepth = false` and `sampleCount = 1`, so their pipelines are built without a depth-stencil descriptor. Depth-hosted layers request `hasDepth = true`, use the target depth-stencil format provided by the frame graph, and set `depthWrite` from the layer's `depth` mode.

### Bind Group Layouts

`Sprite2DLayer` uses the `Layer` UBO described in the per-instance section
above: 48 bytes at the sprite bind group's binding 0, plus atlas texture and
sampler at bindings 1 and 2. Pure `SpriteRenderer` layers bind that group at
group 0. Depth-hosted Sprite2D renderables bind the scene's existing group 0
and the sprite layer group at group 1.

Billboards do **not** allocate a separate sprite-only scene UBO in the current
implementation. The render pass task already owns the canonical scene UBO and
binds it at group 0; billboard WGSL reads `scene.viewProjection` and
`scene.view` from that existing binding. Mesh-only scenes still pay zero
billboard bytes because the billboard renderable/pipeline module is behind the
dynamic import in `billboard-scene.ts`.

The billboard bind group is group 1:

| Binding | Resource              | Shader stages     | Notes                                                     |
| ------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0       | `BillboardSystem` UBO | vertex + fragment | 32 B: `opacityMul: vec4<f32>`, `axisAndCutoff: vec4<f32>` |
| 1       | atlas texture         | fragment          | `texture_2d<f32>` from `system.atlas.texture.view`        |
| 2       | atlas sampler         | fragment          | filtering sampler from the atlas texture                  |

`BillboardSystem.axisAndCutoff.xyz` is the normalized lock axis for axis-locked systems
and zero for facing systems. `axisAndCutoff.w` is the runtime `alphaCutoff` consumed only
by cutout shaders. `opacityMul` is CPU-shaped per blend mode: straight-alpha
and cutout write `(1, 1, 1, opacity)`, while premultiplied writes
`(opacity, opacity, opacity, opacity)` so the fragment shader has no blend-mode
branch.

### Pipeline Cache

Per-device, lazy. Current keys:

- `Sprite2DLayer`: `(format, sampleCount, blendMode, hasDepth, depthWrite, depthStencilFormat)`.
- `BillboardSpriteSystem`: `(format, sampleCount, orientation, blendMode, depthMode, depthStencilFormat)`.

`alphaCutoff` and `opacity` are **not** in the billboard pipeline key. Both live
in the 32-byte system UBO, so animating opacity or tuning cutoff is a UBO write,
not a pipeline recompile. `flipX` / `flipY` are stored by swapping UV min/max in
the per-instance data, not by changing pipelines.

---

## Shader Logic

Composers (one per family / billboard variant) emit complete WGSL strings.
Three composers total: `composeSprite2D` (covers both pure-2D and anchored
layers — the WGSL is identical), `composeFacingBillboard`, and
`composeAxisLockedBillboard`.

### Sprite2DLayer Vertex Shader (covers pure 2D AND anchored)

```wgsl
@group(0) @binding(0) var<uniform> scene: Sprite2DSceneUBO;
@group(1) @binding(2) var<uniform> layer: SpriteLayerUBO;

@vertex fn vs(in: VSIn) -> VSOut {
    let corner = cornerOf(in.vid);
    let localPx = (corner - in.pivot) * in.sizePx;
    let rotated = rotate2(localPx, in.sinCos);
    let layerPx = in.positionPx + rotated;
    let sc = vec2<f32>(sin(scene.viewRotation), cos(scene.viewRotation));
    let viewed = rotate2(layerPx - scene.viewPositionPx, sc) * scene.zoom;
    // PIXEL_SNAP: composer emits floor(viewed + 0.5) when pixelSnap is true.
    let snapped = viewed;
    let ndc = vec2<f32>(
         snapped.x * scene.invViewportPx.x * 2.0 - 1.0,
        1.0 - snapped.y * scene.invViewportPx.y * 2.0,
    );
    // For depth: "none" layers, z is ignored. For depth: "test" / "test-write",
    // layerZ ∈ [0,1] is mapped to NDC depth ∈ [1,0]. The CPU anchor sync writes
    // the projected NDC-z (with depthBias applied) into in.layerZ for anchored sprites.
    let z = 1.0 - clamp(in.layerZ, 0.0, 1.0);
    var out: VSOut;
    out.pos = vec4<f32>(ndc, z, 1.0);
    out.uv = cornerUV(corner, in.uvRect, in.flipX > 0.5, in.flipY > 0.5);
    out.color = in.color;
    return out;
}
```

Crucially: `in.positionPx` already carries the **projected** layer-space
pixel for anchored sprites, written by the CPU sync hook before this
frame's GPU upload. The shader has no idea whether the sprite is anchored.
There is no `if (anchored)`, no per-instance world-position field, and no
wasted bytes for non-anchored sprites.

### Billboard Vertex Shaders

The current billboard path uses a 64-byte per-instance vertex buffer
and `@builtin(vertex_index)` for the four quad corners. The shared composer
emits one of two basis functions from `system._orientation`; the rest of the
vertex shader is identical.

#### Facing (spherical) basis

```wgsl
fn getBillboardBasis(_anchor: vec3<f32>) -> BillboardBasis {
  let cameraRight = normalize(vec3<f32>(scene.view[0][0], scene.view[1][0], scene.view[2][0]));
  let cameraUp = normalize(vec3<f32>(scene.view[0][1], scene.view[1][1], scene.view[2][1]));
  return BillboardBasis(cameraRight, -cameraUp);
}
```

#### Axis-Locked basis

```wgsl
fn getBillboardBasis(_anchor: vec3<f32>) -> BillboardBasis {
  let lockAxis = normalize(billboards.axisAndCutoff.xyz);
  let cameraRight = normalize(vec3<f32>(scene.view[0][0], scene.view[1][0], scene.view[2][0]));
  let projectedRight = cameraRight - lockAxis * dot(cameraRight, lockAxis);
  let projectedRightLen = length(projectedRight);
  let safeProjectedRightLen = max(projectedRightLen, 1e-4);
  let fallbackSeed = select(vec3<f32>(0.0, 0.0, 1.0), vec3<f32>(1.0, 0.0, 0.0), abs(lockAxis.z) > 0.999);
  let fallbackRightRaw = cross(lockAxis, fallbackSeed);
  let fallbackRight = fallbackRightRaw / max(length(fallbackRightRaw), 1e-4);
  let right = select(fallbackRight, projectedRight / safeProjectedRightLen, projectedRightLen > 1e-4);
  return BillboardBasis(right, -lockAxis);
}
```

#### Shared vertex body

```wgsl
@vertex
fn vs(in: VIn) -> VOut {
  let corner = vec2<f32>(select(0.0, 1.0, in.vid == 1u || in.vid == 2u), select(0.0, 1.0, in.vid >= 2u));
  let local = (corner - in.iPivot) * in.iSize;
  let cosRot = cos(in.iRot);
  let sinRot = sin(in.iRot);
  let rotated = vec2<f32>(local.x * cosRot - local.y * sinRot, local.x * sinRot + local.y * cosRot);
  let basis = getBillboardBasis(in.iPos);
  let worldPos = in.iPos + basis.right * rotated.x + basis.up * rotated.y;
  var out: VOut;
  out.pos = scene.viewProjection * vec4<f32>(worldPos, 1.0);
  out.uv = mix(in.iUvMin, in.iUvMax, corner);
  out.tint = in.iColor;
  return out;
}
```

### Billboard Fragment Shader

Transparent billboard shaders sample the atlas and return `sampleColor * tint *
billboards.opacityMul`. Cutout billboard shaders use the same multiply but first
discard fragments whose sampled alpha is below `billboards.axisAndCutoff.w`.

```wgsl
@fragment
fn fs(in: VOut) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {
  let sampleColor = textureSample(atlasTex, atlasSamp, in.uv);
  if (sampleColor.a < billboards.axisAndCutoff.w) {
    discard;
  }
  return sampleColor * in.tint * billboards.opacityMul;
}
```

`alphaCutoff` and `opacity` both live in the billboard system UBO. Neither value
is baked into WGSL or entered into the pipeline cache key.

## Sorting and Transparency

| Family / variant                      | Drawn through                                                               | Render slot                                           | Per-instance ordering                       | Blend     | Depth write |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Sprite2DLayer `depth: "none"`         | a `SpriteRenderer` registered on the engine                                 | engine `_renderingContexts` (after the scene context) | none; no Z slot                             | per-blend | off         |
| Sprite2DLayer `depth: "test"` blended | `addDepthHostedSpriteLayer` → `sprite-renderable.ts` (`order = 200`)        | scene transparent queue (after opaque meshes)         | consumed; per-instance depth test, no write | per-blend | off         |
| Sprite2DLayer `depth: "test"` cutout  | `addDepthHostedSpriteLayer` → `sprite-renderable.ts` (`order = 200`)        | scene transparent queue (after opaque meshes)         | consumed; per-instance depth test, no write | none      | off         |
| Sprite2DLayer `depth: "test-write"`   | `addDepthHostedSpriteLayer` → `sprite-renderable.ts` (`order = 100`)        | direct draw after cached opaque meshes                | consumed; per-instance depth test + write   | per-blend | on          |
| Billboard blended                     | `addFacingBillboardSystem` / `addAxisLockedBillboardSystem` (`order = 200`) | scene transparent queue                               | CPU-sorted far-to-near staging upload       | per-blend | off         |
| Billboard cutout                      | `addFacingBillboardSystem` / `addAxisLockedBillboardSystem` (`order = 100`) | direct draw after cached opaque meshes                | logical insertion order; GPU depth resolves | none      | on          |

Depth-hosted Sprite2D layers do **not** sort sprites individually — each
layer becomes one `Renderable` and the GPU's depth test resolves
overlap between sprites in the same layer (cutout) or between layers
that share the depth buffer. Within a depth-hosted layer, sprites draw in insertion
order, and the per-instance Z (slot [13]) is used as the depth-test
value. Pure-2D layers have no slot [13]. Current transparent billboard systems
sort into renderable-owned scratch buffers and upload the sorted 64-byte
instances without mutating `system._instanceData`. Cutout billboard systems skip
the sort and upload dirty ranges in logical insertion order.

---

## Picking

### `pickSprite2D` — CPU contributor

`pickSprite2D(layers, xPx, yPx)` takes the caller's `Sprite2DLayer` array
(typically `spriteRenderer.layers` for HUD overlays or
`scene._renderables` filtered to the Sprite2D `Renderable`s that
`addToScene` pushed there) and walks them in
reverse insertion order. For each candidate sprite it rotates the screen
point into the sprite's pivot-aware local rectangle. Anchored sprites are
read at their already-projected `positionPx` — no extra projection at
pick time. Returns the first hit (last layer, last sprite within that
layer), or `null`. The caller chooses what to pick by passing the right
layer array; there is no global registry of sprite layers to walk.

### `PickContributor` interface

A generic per-scene contributor pattern lives in
`picking/picking-contributors.ts`:

```typescript
export interface PickContributor {
    /** Issue draw commands into the shared pick pass. Returns the next free pick ID. */
    draw(ctx: PickPassContext, nextPickId: number): number;
    /** Try to resolve a pick ID returned by the GPU. Returns the domain-specific
     *  PickingInfo if this contributor owns the ID, or null otherwise. */
    resolve(pickId: number, worldPoint: [number, number, number] | null, depth: number): PickingInfo | null;
}
```

`gpu-picker.ts` runs all mesh draws first into the 1×1 ID pass (consuming
IDs `1..M`), ends that pass, then opens a second render pass that loads
the same color/depth attachments and dispatches each registered
contributor with the next free pick ID. Each contributor returns the next
free ID after its draws; the picker accumulates and uses the result to
bound mesh-vs-contributor ID dispatch. The depth-test contract (`greater`)
carries across the pass boundary because the second pass loads the
previous depth, so closest-hit semantics are preserved across mesh +
contributor draws.

### Per-system contributor (Billboard)

Each `BillboardSpriteSystem` registers exactly one contributor.
Registration is idempotent (guarded by a `_pickContributorRegistered`
flag on the system) and lives in the system's renderable build path —
the contributor module is dynamic-imported only when a billboard
renderable is actually built, so mesh-only scenes pay zero bytes for
sprite picking code.

**Per-system 80-byte pick UBO**
(`BILLBOARD_PICK_UBO_BYTES = 80`, layout matches the WGSL struct in
`billboard-pick-pipeline.ts`):

| Offset | Field           | Notes                                                            |
| ------ | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0..15  | `cameraRight`   | `vec4<f32>` — xyz from camera world matrix; `w` packs `camPos.x` |
| 16..31 | `cameraUp`      | `vec4<f32>` — xyz; `w` packs `camPos.y`                          |
| 32..47 | `cameraForward` | `vec4<f32>` — xyz; `w` packs `camPos.z`                          |
| 48..63 | `lockAxis`      | `vec4<f32>` — axis variant only; xyz; `w` unused                 |
| 64..67 | `baseId`        | `u32` — first pick ID assigned to instance 0 in this system      |
| 68..71 | `alphaCutoff`   | `f32` — used only when cutout pipeline is selected               |
| 72..79 | `_pad`          | 8 B trailing pad                                                 |

Packing the camera position into the basis vectors' `w` channels keeps
the UBO at 80 B and avoids binding any separate billboard scene UBO in the
pick pass.

**Bind groups.** `@group(0)` = scene UBO (the pick-zoomed VP — same one
mesh picking uses). `@group(1)` = `tex@0`, `samp@1`, system pick UBO at
`@2`, packed sprite storage buffer at `@3` (the same buffer used for
rendering). The bind group is rebuilt lazily — only when
`system._storage.gpuBuffer` (the JS pointer) changes between picks.

**Per-(variant, isCutout) pipeline cache** (`billboard-pick-pipeline.ts`).
Cache key is `"${variant}|${isCutout ? 1 : 0}"`. Six entries maximum
(3 variants × 2 cutout flags). Each pipeline embeds the variant's basis
math (Facing reads `cameraRight.xyz` / `cameraUp.xyz`; Yaw reconstructs
`camPos` from the basis `w` channels and computes
`cross(worldUp, toCam)`; Axis does the same with the lock axis). The
fragment shader writes the pick ID as RGB and depth as `@location(1)`
matching the mesh picker's two-color-attachment contract.

**Pick ID assignment.** Each contributor's `draw` is given `nextPickId`,
draws its sprites with consecutive IDs `[baseId, baseId + count)` (the
WGSL emits `baseId + sortIndex`), and returns `baseId + count` for the
next contributor. Contributors track their own `rangeStart` / `rangeEnd`
for resolve.

**Resolution.** When the GPU picker reads back a pick ID, it iterates
contributors in registration order; the first one whose range contains
the ID returns a `PickingInfo`. The billboard contributor smuggles a
`_spritePick: SpritePickInfo` payload onto the `PickingInfo` object;
`pickBillboardSprite()` extracts it.

**UV reconstruction at resolve time.** Given the engine's reconstructed
world hit point `worldPoint` and the camera's world matrix:

1. Look up `meta = system._meta[localIndex]` for `rotation`, `pivot`, `sizeWorld`.
2. Call `basis = system._basisFn(worldPos, camRight, camUp, camPos)` (no variant branching).
3. Project `worldPoint - worldPos` onto `basis.right` / `basis.up` to get local-plane `(localX, localY)`.
4. Inverse-rotate by `meta.rotation` (positive sin/cos rotation in the shader → negate sin here).
5. Divide by `meta.sizeWorld`, add `meta.pivot`, clamp to `[0, 1]`.

This matches the shader's `(corner - pivot) * sizeWorld` plane definition
exactly.

Each picker lives in its own file (`pick-sprite-2d.ts`,
`pick-billboard.ts`) and is imported only when the corresponding `pick*`
function is called. Apps that never pick a sprite pay zero bytes for the
picker. Mesh-only scenes additionally pay zero bytes for
`picking-contributors.ts`'s body — only the lazy `getPickContributors`
dispatch in `gpu-picker.ts` references it.

## State Machine / Lifecycle

### Atlas + Layer Creation

```text
loadSpriteAtlas(engine, url, opts) → SpriteAtlas

createSprite2DLayer(atlas, { depth })
  └─> { atlas, depth, capacity, _data (Float32Array), _animations,
        _anchored: null,                                      // sparse map; null until first anchor
        _deferredBuild,
        _version, _gpuVersion, _entityType: "sprite-2d-layer" }

createAxisLockedBillboardSystem(atlas, axis, opts)
  └─> { ..., _entityType: "billboard-sprite-system", _orientation: "axis-locked", _axis: normalized(axis), ... }
```

### Depth-Hosted Scene Admission

Depth-hosted sprite admission lives in the sprite module as an opt-in
`addDepthHostedSpriteLayer` helper. Scene core exposes only a generic
`addDeferredSceneRenderables` hook; `addToScene` remains sprite-agnostic.
Renderable construction and depth-mode validation stay in `sprite-renderable.ts`:

```text
addDepthHostedSpriteLayer(scene, layer)
  └─> rejects depth === "none"
  └─> addDeferredSceneRenderables(scene, builder)
  └─> call statically imported buildSpriteRenderable
        └─> buildSpriteRenderable(engine, layer)
        └─> push renderable/disposable into the scene
```

Pure-2D-only apps never call `addToScene` at all — they create a
`SpriteRenderer` directly, register it on the engine, and own their
layers without any scene. HUD-on-3D apps hand their HUD layers to a
separate `SpriteRenderer` and register it on the engine after
`registerScene`; depth-hosted layers go through `addDepthHostedSpriteLayer`.

### Build (at `registerScene`)

`registerScene(scene)` runs each `_deferredBuild`. The sprite deferred builder
calls the statically imported `buildSpriteRenderable`, builds the pipeline (cache-keyed),
allocates the per-layer GPU instance buffer + UBO, and creates bind groups. The
depth-hosted `Renderable` (one per Sprite2D layer added through
`addDepthHostedSpriteLayer`) is pushed into `scene._renderables` with `order = 100`
and `_direct = true` for `depth: "test-write"`, or `order = 200` for
blended / `depth: "test"`, so the scene's existing renderable loop picks it up
alongside opaque and transparent meshes.

`registerScene` does **not** create or own any `SpriteRenderer`. HUD
overlays are entirely caller-managed.

### Per-Frame Render

```text
startEngine(engine) per-frame:
  1. Acquire swap-chain view + create command encoder.
  2. For each context c in engine._renderingContexts (in registration order):
       a. Pre-pass updates: c._update()
            Scene context:
              - Run scene._beforeRender hooks: clip ticks; anchor projection writes positionPx.
              - Run pre-pass renderables and scene uniform updaters.
            SpriteRenderer:
              - For each dirty layer: writeBuffer dirty range; update layer UBO.
       b. Record draws: c._record()
            Scene context:
              - Execute its frame graph. The default swapchain RenderTask
                buckets and draws renderables sorted by `order`:
                  * meshes opaque (order 0)
                  * Sprite2D depth-hosted cutout / `"test-write"` (order 100)
                  * meshes transparent
                  * Sprite2D depth-hosted blended / `"test"` (order 200)
                  * billboards (order 200)
            SpriteRenderer:
              - Open a sprite-only sampleCount=1 pass directly on the
                per-frame swapchain view with no depth attachment.
              - For each layer in this.layers (sorted by layer.order):
                  bind pipeline + groups; drawIndexed(6, count).
  3. Submit command buffer.
```

No `if (is2D)` anywhere. The engine just walks its `_renderingContexts`
list and asks each one to update and record. A `SpriteRenderer` with
zero non-empty layers skips its pass entirely. A scene with no Sprite2D
renderables draws only meshes and billboards.

### Disposal

`disposeScene(scene)` invokes every callback in `scene._disposables`,
including the per-renderable GPU buffer / bind group / pipeline cleanups,
the per-layer anchor hook removal, and the per-target depth/MSAA
attachment releases (existing code; sprites add no new attachments).

Any HUD `SpriteRenderer` the caller registered on the engine is
separately the caller's responsibility to dispose. The recommended
pattern is to wire HUD disposal to the scene lifetime via
`onSceneDispose(scene, () => disposeSpriteRenderer(hud))` after
`registerSpriteRenderer`, so a single `disposeScene(scene)` call also
takes the HUD down.

`disposeSpriteRenderer(sr)` releases the renderer's pipeline cache (per-
device, max four entries), any per-renderer UBO, and is safe to call
without having called `unregisterSpriteRenderer` first — it does both.

## Handles, Identity, and Parenting

Stable handle identity is implemented as an optional layer over the Index API.
Parenting and observable field objects remain roadmap extensions.

Sprites in Babylon Lite use a **two-tier API** that mirrors the
Index/Handle split common in data-oriented engines (and parallels Lite's
ThinInstance vs. Mesh split for 3D geometry).

### Two-tier API design

| Tier           | Functions                                                                                                                                                           | Returns                                    | Use for                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Index API**  | `addSprite2DIndex`, `updateSprite2DIndex`, `removeSprite2DIndex`, `clearSprite2DLayer`, `setSprite2DFrameIndex` (and `addBillboardSpriteIndex` etc. for billboards) | `number` (slot index)                      | Tile maps, scenery, particles, large fixed-layout HUDs. Maximum throughput, zero per-sprite GC. Indices are _not_ stable — `removeXIndex` swap-removes |
| **Handle API** | `addSprite2D`, `removeSprite2D`, `addBillboardSprite`, `removeBillboardSprite` and matching update helpers                                                          | `Sprite2DHandle` / `BillboardSpriteHandle` | Player characters, enemies, UI elements that move or will later be parented. Stable id, remove-safe update helpers                                     |

Mario analogy: `Index` is a scenario tile (set once, never updated, can
spawn 10 000 of them); `Handle` is Mario himself (moves every frame,
parented to a moving platform, owns animation state).

The handle modules live in separate files so that scenes that only use the
Index API never load handle code (see **Tree-shaking** below).
Holding a handle intentionally keeps its owning layer/system reachable for GC
for as long as the handle itself remains reachable.

### Stable IDs (`idToIndex` / `indexToId`)

Each handle owns a `readonly id: number` (u32, monotonically allocated
from the family handle state). The layer/system owns two parallel structures,
lazily allocated on first handle creation:

- `idToIndex: Map<number, number>` — maps `handle.id` → current slot index.
- `indexToId: Uint32Array` — parallel to storage capacity; maps slot index → `handle.id` (0 = no handle for that slot, since ids start at 1).

When `removeXIndex` swap-removes the last slot into the freed slot, it
calls a lazily-installed generic hook that patches both maps so the moved-into
slot's id resolves to its new index.
When `removeSprite2D(handle)` or `removeBillboardSprite(handle)` is called,
the handle module resolves the handle's current slot through `idToIndex` and
then invokes the existing index removal helper. The same hook invalidates the
removed handle id and re-binds any moved-in handle id.

**Cost:** 4 B/slot in `_indexToId` + one Map lookup per handle mutation.
Index API users skip the Map and `Uint32Array` entirely — they keep raw
indices and pay no handle-state allocations. The base state object has only an
optional hook slot, and the hook object is installed by the handle module on the
first `add*` handle call. If the handle module is not imported, bundling drops
it entirely.

### Roadmap observable handle field tables

The current handle API is stable identity plus standalone update/remove
helpers. Observable fields are planned as a later layer over the same ids and
maps.

**`Sprite2DHandle`** (Sprite2D family):

| Field      | Slot floats it writes (per `SPRITE_2D_STRIDE = 20`)                   | Setter side-effects                                                          |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `position` | `[off+0]` = x, `[off+1]` = y                                          | Marks worldMatrix2D dirty; if parented, walker overrides next frame          |
| `sizePx`   | `[off+2]` = w·scale.x, `[off+3]` = h·scale.y (only when un-parented)  | Marks slot dirty                                                             |
| `pivot`    | `[off+4]`, `[off+5]`                                                  | —                                                                            |
| `scale`    | (none directly — scaled into sizePx)                                  | Marks worldMatrix2D dirty; re-writes packed size                             |
| `color`    | `[off+12..15]`                                                        | —                                                                            |
| `rotation` | (via `updateSprite2DIndex` patch — sin/cos at `[off+6..7]`)           | Marks worldMatrix2D dirty                                                    |
| `frame`    | UV at `[off+8..11]`                                                   | Calls `setSprite2DFrameIndex`                                                |
| `visible`  | Toggles packed sizePx between value and 0                             | Calls `writeSizePx`                                                          |
| `pickable` | Updates `_meta[i].pickable`                                           | —                                                                            |
| `layerZ`   | `[off+16]`                                                            | Clamped to `[0, 1]`                                                          |
| `parent`   | (only `IParentable2D`; doesn't touch slot directly)                   | Adds/removes from `_parentedHandles`; installs walker on first parent        |
| `anchor`   | (none directly; CPU projection writes positionPx + layerZ each frame) | Setting `AnchorSource` adds to layer `_anchored` map; setting `null` removes |

**`BillboardSpriteHandle`** (Billboard family) is structurally similar
but uses 3D `position: ObservableVec3` and `sizeWorld: ObservableVec2`
instead of `sizePx`. Its `parent` setter takes any
`IWorldMatrixProvider` (a Mesh, TransformNode, or even another sprite
handle).

### `anchor` setter — anchored sprites are still Sprite2D handles

```typescript
export interface Sprite2DHandle {
    // ... fields above ...

    /** Optional world anchor. Setting this attaches the AnchorSource;
     *  setting null removes it. Setting it to a different AnchorSource
     *  swaps the projection target without recreating the handle. */
    anchor: AnchorSource | null;
}
```

The `anchor` setter delegates to `setSprite2DAnchor(layer, slot, src)` —
which lives in `sprite-anchor.ts`, dynamic-imported on the first anchor
assignment. Handles never used as anchored sprites pay zero bytes for
anchor code. Setting `handle.anchor = createParentAnchor(mesh)` is the
canonical way to pin a sprite to a moving 3D entity; the anchor itself
encodes the parent relationship, which keeps the handle's parenting
story uniform with 3D-tracking handles. Setting it back to `null`
removes the layer's anchor entry and (if the entry was the last)
disposes the per-frame projection hook.

### 3D parenting (Billboard handles)

`BillboardSpriteHandle` implements `IParentable` + `IWorldMatrixProvider`
— the same interfaces meshes use. Setting `handle.parent = mesh` adds
the handle to `system._parentedHandles: Set<IParentedBillboardHandle>`
and installs the per-frame walker via the function-pointer hook
`system._parentedHandlesWalker` (see **Tree-shaking** below).

Each frame, before the storage sync, the renderable invokes the walker
if present. The walker iterates `_parentedHandles`, reads each handle's
`worldMatrix` (resolved lazily through the chain via
`WorldMatrixAccessors`), and writes only the **world translation** into
slot `[off+0..2]`. Sprite rotation stays as a 2D-around-pivot rotation
in the slot; parent rotation and scale do _not_ propagate to the
sprite's quad orientation (billboards face the camera in their
renderable; allowing parent rotation to tilt them would defeat the
point of a billboard). Only translation propagates.

Un-parented handles iterate over zero work — `_parentedHandles` is
`null` until the first `handle.parent = …` call.

### 2D parenting (Sprite2D)

Sprite2D handles implement `IParentable2D` + `IWorldMatrix2DProvider`,
the 2D analogues built on `Mat3` affine matrices instead of `Mat4`. This
enables Spine-style 2D skeletal hierarchies: a parent sprite's rotation
and scale _do_ propagate to children (since Sprite2D quads are
explicitly oriented in 2D, there is no "always face camera" constraint
to violate).

Sprite2D handles add a `scale: ObservableVec2` field (default `(1, 1)`)
so the handle can express non-uniform local scale on top of `sizePx`.
The walker (`walkParentedSprite2DHandles`) decomposes each handle's
world `Mat3` into `(tx, ty)`, rotation, and `(sx, sy)`, then writes:

- `[off+0..1]` = `(tx, ty)` — world translation
- `[off+2..3]` = `(sizePx.x · sx, sizePx.y · sy)` — packed size with world scale
- `[off+4..5]` = pivot (unchanged from local)
- `[off+6..7]` = `(sin(rot), cos(rot))` — world rotation

### Tree-shaking

The handle modules and the walker modules are deliberately **separate
files** so the static import graph of each renderable stays free of
handle code:

- **Renderable files** (`sprite-renderable.ts`, `billboard-renderable.ts`)
  statically import only the family state files (`sprite-2d.ts`,
  `billboard-sprite.ts`) — no handle modules, no walker modules. Future handle
  support should continue to use function-pointer hooks so Index-only scenes
  pay zero handle-walker cost.
- **Handle modules** statically import only the family index module. Future
  parenting support must stay in separate walker modules assigned through
  function-pointer hooks on first `handle.parent = …`, so apps that use handles
  but never parent still do not load walker code.
- **Apps that only use the Index API** (e.g. a tile-map scene) never
  import any handle module, so `idToIndex` / `indexToId` /
  `_parentedHandles` / `_parentedHandlesWalker` are never allocated. The
  handle module's bytes are tree-shaken out of the bundle entirely.

### Future physics integration

The handle's `position: ObservableVec3` (or `ObservableVec2` for
Sprite2D) is the natural integration point for a future
`@babylon-lite/physics-2d` / `physics-3d` package. A physics body would
write to `handle.position.x = …` each frame from its solver state via a
per-frame sync; the observable's write-back path picks up the change and
pushes it into the GPU buffer (or into the world matrix for parented
handles). No core changes required.

This preserves the "if you don't use it, you don't pay for it" boundary:
physics is an optional package that only sees the public Handle API and
never reaches into layer internals.

### Roadmap Anchored Sizing — Common Porting Pitfalls

The CPU projection code in `sprite-anchor.ts` follows the same contract
the GPU vertex shader would have used: `clipPos.w = cz` (camera-space
depth, not 3D distance), screen-up = camera up. Anchored sprites
maintain a fixed pixel size by adding a clip-space pixel offset to the
projected anchor.

When porting "constant pixel size" code from a hand-written BJS scene
that recomputes `sprite.size` per frame, two BJS-side mistakes look
correct in isolation but disagree with Lite's exact projection:

- **Use camera-space depth `cz`, not 3D distance.** The BJS sprite shader
  uses `clipPos.w = cz` for perspective divide, so the world-per-pixel
  scale at any anchor is `(2 · cz · tan(fov/2)) / viewportHeight`.
  Computing `Vector3.Distance(anchor, camPos)` over-scales off-axis
  sprites because distance includes the lateral component the
  projection does not. Extract `cz` from the view matrix as
  `|forward · anchor + tz|` (BJS view matrix per `Matrix.LookAtLHToRef`:
  forward axis `(m[2], m[6], m[10])`, translation
  `(m[12], m[13], m[14])`).

- **Apply screen-space offsets along the camera's up axis, not world-Y.**
  A "−32 px in screen space" offset on a tilted camera is along
  screen-up (which maps to the world-up axis of the view matrix:
  `(m[1], m[5], m[9])`), not world-Y. World-Y only equals screen-up when
  the camera is not tilted.

Lite's anchored projection does the equivalent in clip space directly
(anchor projected through VP, then `offsetPx` added as
`(2 · offsetPx / viewport) · w`), so neither pitfall applies on the
Lite side — they show up only when porting or authoring a parity
reference. The same maths is now performed on the CPU each frame for
anchored Sprite2D layers; the projection helper in `sprite-anchor.ts`
implements `(2 · offsetPx / viewport) · w` exactly.

## Dependencies

Imports:

- `Texture2D`, `loadTexture2D` from `../texture/texture-2d.js`
- `EngineContext` from `../engine/engine.js`
- (only in `addDepthHostedSpriteLayer` integration code, not in pure-2D bundles) `SceneContext` from `../scene/scene-core.js`, type-only
- (only in `addDepthHostedSpriteLayer` integration code, not in pure-2D bundles) `addDeferredSceneRenderables` from `../scene/scene-core.js`
- (only in `addDepthHostedSpriteLayer` integration code, not in pure-2D bundles) `buildSpriteRenderable` from `./sprite-renderable.js`
- (only in `billboard-scene.ts`, not in pure-2D bundles) `SceneContext` and `addDeferredSceneRenderables` from `../scene/scene-core.js`
- (only in the dynamic billboard renderable chunk) `getViewMatrix`, `getSceneBindGroupLayout`, GPU buffer helpers, and the billboard pipeline module

Lazy / dynamic-imported:

- `billboard-renderable.ts` and `billboard-pipeline.ts` — pulled in by `addFacingBillboardSystem` / `addAxisLockedBillboardSystem` only when `registerScene` runs the queued billboard builder.

Depended on by:

- `lab/lite/src/lite/scene50.ts` through `scene57.ts` — current 2D, HUD, depth-hosted, and billboard reference scenes. Custom-shader, UV-scroll, and additive/multiply blend scenes are `scene92.ts` through `scene98.ts`.
- Future Particles module — should reuse `SpriteAtlas`, the vertexless-quad pattern, and packed-instance-buffer helpers.

NOT depended on:

- PBR / Standard / Background materials, ShaderComposer, Mesh, Skeleton, Morph, Shadow modules — sprites use standalone WGSL with no fragment composition.

---

## Test Specification

### Unit (vitest)

- `sprite-renderer.test.ts` — pure-2D renderer lifecycle, layer membership, pipeline cache, and depth-mode guardrails.
- `sprite-depth-hosted-routing.test.ts` — `addDepthHostedSpriteLayer(scene, layer)` routing, depth-stencil pipeline formats, upload sizes, bind-group compatibility, and disposal.
- `billboard-sprite.test.ts` — compact billboard instance layout, scene helper routing, transparent CPU sorting, cutout depth-write pipeline state, and axis normalization.
- `render-pass-task.test.ts` — transparent binding updates run before transparent-bucket sorting, so billboard `_worldCenter` changes affect same-frame draw order.
- `rendering-context-registration.test.ts` — engine rendering-context registration, scene registration idempotence, disposal unregistering, and pre-registration frame-graph task recording.

### Visualization (Playwright)

Existing scene families port across (the goldens are pixel-equivalent
because the projection math is the same):

- **Scene 50/51-sprite-grid** — pure `Sprite2DLayer` driven by a `SpriteRenderer` registered on the engine; no `SceneContext` exists.
- **Scene 52-hud-on-3d** — a 3D scene plus a separately-registered `SpriteRenderer` for the HUD layers.
- **Scene 53-depth-hosted-sprites** — `Sprite2DLayer { depth: "test" | "test-write" }` added to the scene via `addDepthHostedSpriteLayer`.
- **Scene 54-facing-billboards** — facing billboard system, alpha blending, and depth test against opaque boxes.
- **Scene 55-billboard-sorting** — transparent billboard CPU sorting before compact instance upload.
- **Scene 56-axis-locked-billboards** — arbitrary-axis locked billboard basis math.
- **Scene 57-cutout-billboards** — cutout billboard alpha discard, no blend state, and depth writes.

Feature scenes added on the `engine/sprite-additive-customshader` branch (each with a Lite impl, a Babylon.js oracle, and a parity spec):

- **Scene 92-sprite-customshader-params** — 2D sprite custom shader driven by an `fx.params` tint.
- **Scene 93-sprite-customshader-palette** — 2D sprite custom shader with a 256×1 palette-remap lookup texture.
- **Scene 94-billboard-customshader-params** — facing billboard custom shader, `fx.params` tint.
- **Scene 95-billboard-customshader-palette** — facing billboard custom shader, palette remap.
- **Scene 96-sprite-uvoffset-parallax** — `uvScroll` layer with bands of fixed `uvOffset` (parallax).
- **Scene 97-sprite-multiply-blend** — `spriteBlendMultiply`.
- **Scene 98-billboard-additive-blend** — `billboardBlendAdditive`.

### Bundle Size Ceilings

Bundle-size ratchets:

- **Pure-2D ceiling.** A pure-2D entry point that imports only `createEngine`, `loadSpriteAtlas`, `createSprite2DLayer`, `addSprite2DIndex`, `createSpriteRenderer`, `registerSpriteRenderer`, and `startEngine` must NOT fetch any of: `scene/scene-core.js`, `sprite-anchor.js`, `billboard-renderable.js`, `billboard-pipeline.js`, `camera/*`, `light/*`, `mesh/*`, `shadow/*`, `material/pbr/*`, `material/standard/*`, `picking/*`. This is the single most important ceiling — it is what justifies splitting `SpriteRenderer` into its own module separate from the scene.
- **Depth-hosted-no-billboard ceiling.** A scene with depth-hosted Sprite2D layers but no billboards must NOT fetch billboard renderables, billboard pipelines, or the GPU picker.
- **Billboard scene-helper ceiling.** Importing billboard factory functions without queueing a billboard system into a scene must NOT runtime-fetch `billboard-renderable.ts` / `billboard-pipeline.ts`.
- **Mesh-only no-sprite ceiling.** A scene with no sprites must NOT fetch `sprite-2d.js`, `sprite-renderer.js`, or billboard modules.

## Sprite Frame Animation (Optional)

**Modules:** `sprite-animation.ts` for side-effect-free sprite frame state/update logic, `sprite-animation-task.ts` for generic `AnimationManager` integration, plus one tiny family binding module per target kind. Static sprites import none of them and pay zero animation bytes.

Provides Babylon.js-style per-sprite frame animation for both Sprite2D (index/handle) and BillboardSprite (index/handle) families. Animations are collected by a `SpriteAnimationManager`, which can be:

- Manually driven via `updateSpriteAnimationManager(manager, deltaMs)`
- Registered with the generic `AnimationManager` via `addSpriteAnimationManager(animationManager, spriteManager)`
- Attached to a `SceneContext` via `attachSpriteAnimationsToScene(scene, manager)` to update in `scene._beforeRender`
- Attached to a `SpriteRenderer` via `attachSpriteAnimationsToRenderer(sr, manager)` to update before layer uploads

### Core Principles

- **Zero module-level side effects.** No allocations at import time.
- **Optional attachment helpers.** Base sprite families never import animation code. The core module has no sprite-family runtime imports; family binding modules import only the specific index or handle helpers they need.
- **Babylon.js timing semantics:**
  - Starts immediately at `from` frame
  - Advances one frame when accumulated time **strictly exceeds** delay (not `>=`)
  - Large delta (> delay) advances only one frame per update (clamps frame step)
  - Loop resets to `from`; non-loop lands on `to` and fires callback once
  - Reverse direction (`from > to`) supported; non-loop reverse ends at `to`
  - Delay clamped to minimum 1ms
- **Index vs handle separation.** Index-only callers pay zero bytes for handle tracking code. Handle-based animations survive swap-remove via stable identity.
- **Raw-index animations are slot animations.** `playSprite2DIndexAnimation` and `playBillboardSpriteIndexAnimation` intentionally bind to the numeric slot for structurally stable layers/systems. If a caller swap-removes that slot, the animation follows the new occupant. Use the handle helpers for stable sprite identity.
- **Manager ownership is explicit.** Adding an animation tracks it with the owning manager. Re-adding the same animation to the same manager is an O(1) no-op; adding it to another manager detaches it from the previous owner first. Finish, removal, and clear paths unset the owner internally.
- **Replay options are explicit.** `playSpriteFrameAnimation` preserves existing callback/removal options when its `options` argument is omitted, and replaces them when an options object is provided.
- **`removeWhenFinished` option** (equivalent to Babylon.js disposing after an animation finishes):
  - For handles: calls `removeSprite2D(handle)` or `removeBillboardSprite(handle)`
  - For raw indices: calls `removeSprite2DIndex(layer, index)` or `removeBillboardSpriteIndex(system, index)` on the current occupant of that slot (swap-remove semantics apply)

```

Underscore-prefixed runtime bookkeeping such as RAF handles, active render-loop bindings, and animation ownership/direction tracking is intentionally kept behind non-exported internal types. The only underscored fields in the public API block are discriminator tags.

### Usage Example

```typescript
// Scene-based with attachment
const scene = createSceneContext(engine);
const atlas = await loadSpriteAtlas(engine, "sprites.png", { gridSize: [32, 32] });
const layer = createSprite2DLayer(atlas, { depth: "test" });
addDepthHostedSpriteLayer(scene, layer);

const animMgr = createSpriteAnimationManager();
attachSpriteAnimationsToScene(scene, animMgr);

const handle = addSprite2D(layer, { positionPx: [100, 200], sizePx: [64, 64], frame: 0 });
playSprite2DAnimation(animMgr, handle, 0, 7, true, 100); // 8-frame loop at 100ms/frame

// Pure-2D with manual update
const sr = createSpriteRenderer(engine, { layers: [layer] });
const binding = attachSpriteAnimationsToRenderer(sr, animMgr);
// Animation now updates before sprite uploads
```

### Implementation Notes

- `updateSpriteAnimationManager` iterates `manager.animations`, accumulates time, advances frame when `accumulatedMs > delayMs` (not `>=`), and removes finished non-loop animations after the callback/removal path has run.
- `sprite-animation-task.ts` creates the sprite-side `AnimationTask` adapter and registers it with the generic `AnimationManager`. This lets one manager advance glTF/property animation groups and sprite frame animations in the same loop without the animation core importing sprite code.
- `startSpriteAnimationManager` / `stopSpriteAnimationManager` keep the existing standalone sprite API, but internally schedule the sprite manager through a private generic `AnimationManager` in `sprite-animation-task.ts`. Sprite-specific scene/renderer attachments remain in `sprite-animation.ts`.
- Attachment helpers:
  - `attachSpriteAnimationsToScene` unshifts a `_beforeRender` hook that receives scene delta and calls `updateSpriteAnimationManager`. Dispose via `disposeSpriteAnimationBinding`; disposal splices the hook and clears the manager's internal binding state. Scene-attached bindings also register the same cleanup with scene disposal, so `disposeScene(scene)` releases that binding state.
  - `attachSpriteAnimationsToRenderer` pushes a callback into the renderer's internal before-update hook list; `SpriteRenderer._update` passes the engine's current delta to these hooks before layer upload. Dispose splices only that callback via `disposeSpriteAnimationBinding` and clears the manager's internal binding state. Renderer-attached bindings register the same cleanup with `disposeSpriteRenderer`, so renderer disposal also releases that binding state.
- Family helpers live in separate modules. `sprite-2d-index-animation.ts` imports no handle code; `sprite-2d-handle-animation.ts` imports the stable-handle helpers. Billboard index/handle helpers follow the same split.
- Index target tracking uses raw slot indices. If the index is swap-removed by non-animation code, the animation follows raw-index semantics and continues targeting the same numeric slot. Callers should use handles for animated sprites that may be removed externally, or manually stop animations before remove.
- Handle target tracking uses stable `Sprite2DHandle` or `BillboardSpriteHandle`. Swap-remove is safe; the handle stays valid until the animation removes it via `removeWhenFinished`.

### Public-API additions to `packages/babylon-lite/src/index.ts`

```typescript
// ─── Engine ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
export type { RenderingContext, EngineContext } from "./engine/engine.js";
// `startEngine(engine)` walks `engine._renderingContexts` in registration order.
export { startEngine } from "./engine/engine.js";

// ─── Scene ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The existing scene API is unchanged. Depth-hosted Sprite2D layers use
// `addDepthHostedSpriteLayer`; HUD overlays use `createSpriteRenderer` +
// `registerSpriteRenderer`.
// `onSceneDispose(scene, cb)` is the public hook for tying caller-owned
// resources (typically a HUD `SpriteRenderer`) to the scene's lifetime.
export { addToScene, registerScene, disposeScene, onSceneDispose } from "./scene/scene.js";

// ─── Sprites ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The engine-registerable sprite renderer — usable with OR without a SceneContext.
