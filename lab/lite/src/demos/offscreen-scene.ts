/**
 * Demo — Offscreen, shared scene.
 *
 * A single, completely DOM-free scene builder used by BOTH render paths of the
 * Offscreen demo:
 *   - the main thread, rendering into a regular `<canvas>`, and
 *   - a Web Worker, rendering into an `OffscreenCanvas` transferred to it.
 *
 * It renders the glTF "Flight Helmet" PBR model (the same asset the babylon.js
 * Offscreen demo uses) inside a studio environment (image-based lighting + DDS
 * skybox + reflective ground), with the camera slowly orbiting it. Crucially the
 * whole thing is built with only worker-safe APIs — `fetch`, `createImageBitmap`,
 * `OffscreenCanvas`, dynamic `import()` — and it never touches `window` or
 * `document`, so the EXACT same code produces the EXACT same image whether it
 * runs on the main thread or inside a Web Worker. That's the whole point of the
 * demo: the only difference between the two canvases is WHERE the Lite engine
 * runs, not WHAT it renders.
