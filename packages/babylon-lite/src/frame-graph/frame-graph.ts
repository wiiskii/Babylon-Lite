/**
 * FrameGraph — orchestrates a scene's per-frame GPU work as an ordered list
 * of tasks. There is no privileged "main" task: a scene-render task that
 * draws into the swapchain is just one task among many. Pre-pass RTTs run
 * first, the scene-render task draws into the swapchain, UI overlay tasks
 * run after, etc. Order is the user's responsibility (controlled via
 * `addTask`, `addTaskAtStart`, and `addTaskBefore`).
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   1. createFrameGraph(engine, scene)      → empty graph
 *   2. addTask{,AtStart,Before}             → register tasks
 *      (createSceneContext registers a default scene-render task)
 *   3. fg.build()                           → record every task
 *      (allocate render-target textures, build pass descriptors)
 *   4. fg.execute()                         → drain every task into the
 *      current command encoder (called from scene._record)
 *   5. fg.dispose()                         → free everything
