/**
 * Task — the polymorphic interface that all frame-graph tasks must implement.
 *
 * Modelled on Babylon.js' `FrameGraphTask`, pared down for Babylon-Lite:
 *   - The interface uses methods so the frame graph can dispatch
 *     polymorphically — same pattern as `Renderable.draw`.
 *   - A task records one or more `Pass` instances during `record()` (via the
 *     public `addRenderPass(...)` action and friends). `_executeTask()` iterates
 *     `_passes` per frame.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   - Engine is captured at task creation and exposed as `engine`.
 *     Scene-owned tasks also expose `scene`; scene-less effect/post-process
 *     tasks leave it undefined so standalone frame graphs stay tree-shakable.
 *   - `record()` is called synchronously when the frame graph is built (via
 *     `FrameGraph.build()`). Tasks use this to allocate GPU resources, build
 *     their render-pass descriptor, and finalize anything that needs the
 *     final canvas / target size. Pass instances are created here via
 *     `addRenderPass(fg, name)` and pushed into `_passes`.
 *   - `_executeTask()` is called once per frame and returns the number of draw
 *     calls issued by all recorded passes.
 *   - `dispose()` is called when the frame graph is disposed.
