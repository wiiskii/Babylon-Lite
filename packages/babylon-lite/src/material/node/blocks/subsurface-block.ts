/** SubSurfaceBlock — passthrough marker.
 *
 *  All actual subsurface math (translucency back-scatter, refraction sampling,
 *  Beer-Lambert tint absorption) is implemented inside PBRMetallicRoughnessBlock,
 *  which walks into the connected SubSurfaceBlock to read its inputs:
 *    - thickness, tintColor, translucencyIntensity, translucencyDiffusionDist
 *    - refraction (`->` RefractionBlock for intensity / tintAtDistance)
 *  This emitter only exists to register the class and report `usesSubsurface`
 *  so the build pipeline can include any related infrastructure.
