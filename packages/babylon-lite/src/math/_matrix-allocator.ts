/** @internal Matrix allocator with strict lazy init. Zero work happens at
 *  module load — `_allocate` starts undefined; the first call to
 *  `allocateMat4()` resolves the default (F32) allocator. When
 *  `_setHpmAllocator` is called (by `createEngine` with HPM=true), it
 *  installs the F64 allocator imported from `_mat4-storage-f64.ts`.
 *
 *  **Constraint (known limitation):** the allocator is process-global.
 *  Pages that mix HPM and non-HPM engines are unsupported — the second
 *  engine silently inherits the first engine's storage precision. See
 *  `docs/architecture/33-high-precision-matrix.md` for the rationale.
 *
 *  This pattern replaces the per-engine `_matrixPolicy` field that previously
 *  threaded the allocator through every entity factory and loader. Removing
 *  the field shaves ~300-500 bytes per scene (no more closure captures,
 *  no `LoaderScratch` struct, no `engine.` prefix at every allocation site). */
